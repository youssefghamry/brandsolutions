Here are some interesting trends to watch:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-smart-appliances-and-io-t\">1. Smart Appliances and IoT<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Appliances are getting smarter and connected to the internet. They learn your habits and can be controlled by phone or voice.<br>Example: fridges that track groceries, ovens that set cooking times by themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-sustainability-and-energy-efficiency\">2. Sustainability and Energy Efficiency<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern appliances use less electricity and eco-friendly materials.<br>Governments also encourage this through rules and rewards, and companies are taking more responsibility for recycling old products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-multifunctional-and-compact-designs\">3. Multifunctional and Compact Designs<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Appliances are smaller and do more jobs at once, perfect for tight spaces.<br>Like an oven that\u2019s also an air fryer, or a washer that fits under a counter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-personalization-and-customization\">4. Personalization and Customization<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>People want appliances that match their style and needs.<br>Choose colors or finishes you like. Plus, smart tech can adjust settings just for you or suggest recipes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-e-commerce-and-omnichannel-sales\">5. E-commerce and Omnichannel Sales<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>More people are buying appliances online or directly from brands, which can be cheaper and give a more personal shopping experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-changing-demographics\">6. Changing Demographics<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Young generations love smart tech, and rising middle classes in many countries are buying more appliances as they move to cities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div
