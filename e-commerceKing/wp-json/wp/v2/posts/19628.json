By 2029, projections place it at $1.65 trillion, growing at an impressive annual rate of 11.8%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s fueling this rise? Easier payment options, better internet access, more smartphones in consumers\u2019 hands, and a shift in shopping habits toward online convenience. Urbanization and rising awareness about eCommerce are also opening doors for new players.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking ahead, we\u2019ll see more AI-driven shopping assistants, virtual try-ons powered by augmented reality, and an even stronger demand for sustainable fashion ecommerce and ethical fashion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"consumer-behavior-and-shopping-habits\">Consumer Behavior and Shopping Habits<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>How people shop for fashion has changed, especially for younger buyers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brands with a strong social media presence attract <a href=\"https:\/\/explodingtopics.com\/blog\/gen-z-spending#:~:text=29%25%20of%20Gen%20Z%20are%20more%20likely%20to%20purchase%20things%20from%20companies%20with%20a%20social%20media%20presence\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">29% of Gen Z<\/a> consumers.

Apparel has one of the highest return rates in eCommerce. Online apparel return rates often range between 40\u201350%. It&#8217;s a costly cycle, but giving reliable fit details and visuals can cut returns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trust is another big factor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>85% of shoppers say they trust online reviews as much as a friend\u2019s recommendation.

Here are some of the most important KPIs for fashion eCommerce:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conversion Rate (CR) \u2013<\/strong> How many visitors actually buy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Average Order Value (AOV) \u2013<\/strong> The average amount spent per transaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) \u2013<\/strong> How much you spend to get each new customer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) \u2013<\/strong> How much a customer spends over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Return Rate \u2013<\/strong> Especially important in fashion, where sizing and fit cause higher returns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate &#8211;<\/strong> The percentage of shoppers who add items to their cart but leave before completing the purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bounce Rate &#8211;<\/strong> The percentage of visitors who leave your site after viewing only one page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Impressions &#8211;<\/strong> The number of times your website, product listing, or ad is displayed to users, regardless of whether they click.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Returning Customer Rate &#8211;<\/strong> The percentage of customers who make repeat purchases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-are-the-biggest-trends-and-challenges-in-online-fashion-retail\">What are The Biggest Trends and Challenges in Online Fashion Retail?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Online fashion retail is changing fast. Shoppers have more choices and higher expectations than ever. To stay ahead, brands need to follow the trends and tackle the challenges shaping the market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s have a look at the biggest fashion eCommerce trends:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ai-personalization\">AI &amp; Personalization<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AI is making fashion shopping smarter. Retailers use data to recommend products based on browsing and purchase history. Tailored recommendations enrich customer experience and raise sales. AI picks trending colors, writes product titles, and answers customer questions. Some brands use AI stylists to suggest full outfits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fast-fashion-evolution\">Fast Fashion Evolution<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast fashion is shifting towards more sustainable and ethical models. Brands are finding ways to deliver trendy pieces quickly without ignoring environmental concerns. This change is driven by consumer demand for both speed and responsibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-metaverse\">The Metaverse<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Virtual fashion shows, digital clothing, and 3D avatars are entering mainstream retail. The metaverse allows customers to try on items virtually and shop in immersive environments. It\u2019s blending entertainment with shopping.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This technology creates a more personalized shopping experience. Users can see how items might look on them without trying them on. Customers can explore different styles and trends in a lively way. As this trend grows, it may change traditional retail models and how consumers interact with brands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"direct-to-consumer-dtc\">Direct-to-Consumer (DTC)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>More brands are now selling directly to customers. This skips traditional retail channels. It gives brands better control over pricing, branding, and customer relationships. It also allows for quicker feedback and trend adoption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"360-product-images\">360\u00b0 Product Images<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Shoppers want to see every detail before buying. 360-degree product views let them rotate and inspect items online. This reduces uncertainty and helps lower return rates.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"social-commerce\">Social Commerce<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media is becoming a direct sales channel. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest let customers discover, review, and buy products without leaving the app. It turns browsing into instant buying.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This smooth process removes the need to visit other websites. It makes shopping easier for consumers. With attractive content and influencers showing products, social media creates a fun space that encourages quick buying. Users scroll through their feeds, see items suggested by friends or influencers, and can buy right away. This change helps consumers enjoy a simple shopping experience. It also gives brands a chance to reach potential customers where they already spend their time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media is interactive and helps build community. Users share reviews and feedback, which can influence others&#8217; buying choices. Brands use these interactions to create trust and loyalty by connecting authentically with their audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"blockchain-technology\">Blockchain Technology<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain improves supply chain transparency and allows customers to track product origins and combat counterfeits in fashion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"omnichannel-experience\">Omnichannel Experience<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Shoppers move between online and offline touchpoints. A smooth omnichannel journey where apps, stores, and websites are connected creates consistency. It builds trust and makes the buying process seamless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sustainability\">Sustainability<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Eco-conscious fashion is no longer a niche. Customers demand environmentally friendly fabrics, ethical sourcing, and recyclable packaging. Brands that adopt sustainable practices gain loyalty and long-term trust.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we know the latest trends shaping online fashion retail, let\u2019s have a look at the key challenges businesses face in this fast-changing market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"key-challenges\">Key Challenges in Fashion eCommerce<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"high-return-rates\">High Return Rates<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fashion eCommerce struggles with returns due to sizing issues, style mismatches, or buyer\u2019s remorse. Handling returns increases costs and affects profit margins. Reducing them requires better sizing tools, product visuals, and accurate descriptions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"supply-chain-disruptions\">Supply Chain Disruptions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fashion depends on global suppliers, and disruptions can cause stock shortages and unhappy customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"intense-competition\">Intense Competition<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The online fashion space is crowded. Established brands, DTC startups, and global platforms all compete for attention. Standing out requires a strong brand identity, smart marketing, and a memorable customer experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sustainability-pressures\">Sustainability Pressures<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While customers want eco-friendly products, achieving true sustainability is expensive. From sourcing ethical fabrics to reducing carbon footprints, brands must balance responsibility with profitability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rising-customer-expectations\">Rising Customer Expectations<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Today\u2019s shoppers have come to expect not only fast shipping but also personalized experiences and round-the-clock service. To meet these expectations, businesses must invest in advanced technology, employ skilled staff, and implement efficient processes. However, it\u2019s important to note that all of these enhancements can lead to increased operational costs, which can impact overall profitability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"data-privacy-security\">Data Privacy &amp; Security<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Online fashion retailers collect sensitive customer data. Any data breach risks customer trust and legal consequences. Strong cybersecurity and transparent policies are essential but costly to maintain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"logistics-last-mile-delivery\">Logistics &amp; Last-Mile Delivery<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast, reliable delivery is a must, but last-mile logistics are often the most complex and expensive part of the process. Traffic, remote locations, and high delivery volumes create bottlenecks for businesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-adoption-costs\">Technology Adoption Costs<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Adopting AI, AR, blockchain, or omnichannel solutions improves competitiveness, but the costs can be overwhelming for smaller brands. Balancing innovation with budget constraints remains a constant challenge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"opportunities-in-the-online-fashion-retail-space\">Opportunities in the Online Fashion Retail Space<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The fashion eCommerce industry is full of room for growth. While trends highlight what\u2019s shaping the market, opportunities are about where businesses can take action and win.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One major opportunity is tapping into <strong>untapped markets<\/strong>. Many regions are still underserved by online fashion retailers. Brands that localize their websites, offer region-specific sizing, or adapt to cultural preferences can stand out quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another space for growth is <strong>loyalty and retention programs<\/strong>. With return rates being so high in fashion, encouraging repeat purchases through exclusive discounts, membership benefits, or early access to collections can help keep customers engaged for the long term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sustainable practices<\/strong> also open new doors. Gen Z and Millennials seek eco-friendly products and are willing to pay more. Businesses using recycled materials and transparent supply chains can attract these conscious consumers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Technology-driven experiences<\/strong> present another opportunity. AR try-on tools, virtual fitting rooms, and better product visualization can reduce returns and increase shopper confidence.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, opportunities lie in new markets, customer trust, sustainability, and technology. Brands that act now will lead the online fashion retail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"successful-e-commerce-fashion-business-models\">Successful eCommerce Fashion Business Models<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fashion brands online use different strategies to reach customers and make money. Here are the main approaches that work today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"core-foundation-models\">Core Foundation Models<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the fundamental structures most fashion eCommerce businesses are built on. They define how products are sold, how revenue flows, and whether the focus is B2C (direct to consumers) or B2B (wholesale and supplier-focused). While most fashion eCommerce brands operate in B2C, B2B models also play a role by powering bulk orders and wholesale platforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"direct-to-consumer-dtc-1\">Direct-to-Consumer (DTC):<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You make it. You sell it. You keep the profit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No wholesalers. No third-party retailers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just you and the customer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gives you control over pricing, brand story, customer data, and experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brands like Everlane, Allbirds, and Glossier built this way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you pay for everything: Ads, inventory, returns, shipping. And you have to earn trust from zero.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It only works if you can build loyalty, not just traffic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"marketplace-model\">Marketplace Model<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people think of marketplaces as places to sell. But you can also own the marketplace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two sides:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Sellers who list their fashion products on platforms like Amazon Fashion, Zalando, or SHEIN<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Platform owners who build and run the marketplace itself \u2014 and let multiple brands sell on it<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As a seller, you get instant traffic. You reach millions of shoppers without building your own audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you lose control. Pricing gets competitive. Customers belong to the platform. And you\u2019re always one algorithm change away from losing visibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a platform owner, it\u2019s the opposite. You don\u2019t make the clothes. You create the platform, then onboard fashion brands to sell on it. You earn a commission on every sale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strategic-approaches\">Strategic Approaches<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These approaches build on the core models, adding unique value propositions or differentiators that help brands stand out in a crowded, competitive industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hybrid-curation-private-label\">Hybrid Curation &amp; Private Label<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A mix of marketplace and own-brand products.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Builds trust with curated collections while pushing in-house labels for higher margins.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Example: ASOS curates global brands but also sells ASOS Design.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sustainable-experiential\">Sustainable &amp; Experiential<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Focus on eco-friendly, ethical fashion.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adds \u201cexperience\u201d through customization, virtual try-ons, or styling.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Appeals to younger buyers who value purpose-driven shopping.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Example: Everlane.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"low-barrier-entry\">Low-Barrier Entry<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Allows new brands to start with low cost (dropshipping, print-on-demand, social selling).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>High competition, but great for niche players.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technologys-role-in-transforming-fashion-e-commerce\">Technology\u2019s Role in Transforming Fashion eCommerce<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t need to be a tech company to use smart tech.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fashion eCommerce, the real winners aren\u2019t always the ones with the best designs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\u2019re the ones who use technology to cut costs, scale faster, and reduce friction.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may have seen the whole internet talking about AI stylists or virtual try-ons. We have already covered those above. Here are also the facts in terms of technology that matter just as much &#8211;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backend-operations\">Backend Operations<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The backend is the engine that keeps fashion eCommerce running smoothly. It ensures that everything from stock updates to supplier coordination and order processing happens easily in real time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"inventory-synchronization\">Inventory Synchronization<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern systems automate inventory management across channels, instantly updating stock when an item sells on platforms like Instagram.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"supplier-coordination\">Supplier Coordination<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Fashion brands work with dozens of manufacturers worldwide. Cloud platforms connect suppliers directly to inventory systems. Manufacturers update delivery dates and production status in real-time, removing endless email chains or missed deadlines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"automated-order-processing\">Automated Order Processing<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Orders automatically move from sale to fulfillment and shipping, with routing to the nearest warehouse for faster delivery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"platform-infrastructure\">Platform Infrastructure<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A strong platform foundation is essential to handle the scale, security, and speed of the eCommerce fashion industry. From databases to payments, each layer ensures customers enjoy a smooth and reliable shopping experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"database-architecture\">Database Architecture<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Fashion catalogs feature millions of product variations, managed by advanced databases for attributes and high traffic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"payment-processing-at-scale\">Payment Processing at Scale<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern platforms handle multiple currencies, payment methods, and tax calculations automatically.

Both are dominant online, but with opposite paths to growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"shein\">SHEIN<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>SHEIN didn\u2019t win with better fabric or celebrity campaigns. They won with speed, data, and obsession over cost.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Business Strategy:<\/strong> Shein perfected the low barrier entry model. Items start at $2 or lower, making it easy for customers to try the brand. They upload approximately 2,000 new products daily, creating endless variety and urgency to buy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Technology Integration:<\/strong> Data drives everything at Shein. They analyze social media trends, search patterns, and customer behavior in real-time. This data feeds directly into design and production decisions within days, not months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their algorithm tests small batches of new designs. Popular items get scaled up immediately. Unpopular ones disappear quickly. This reduces waste and maximizes hit rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;small batch, quick response&#8221; model means suppliers produce a short amount initially. Successful designs get reordered within 48 hours. This keeps inventory fresh while minimizing risk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marketing Mastery:<\/strong> Shein conquered social media without traditional advertising. They created an affiliate program where influencers earn commission on sales. Micro-influencers with 1,000 followers get the same opportunities as major stars.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>User-generated content powers their growth. Customers post &#8220;Shein hauls&#8221; showing multiple purchases. This creates authentic social proof and drives viral marketing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Lessons<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Speed beats perfection in fast fashion<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Data-driven decisions reduce guesswork<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Micro-influencer marketing costs less than traditional ads<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Direct supplier relationships enable rapid scaling<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-m\">H&amp;M<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>H&amp;M has embraced digital change while using its physical stores to stay relevant against online competitors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Omnichannel Integration:<\/strong> H&amp;M connected online and offline experiences seamlessly. Customers can buy online and return in-store. Store associates access online inventory to fulfill customer requests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their &#8220;Click and Collect&#8221; service drives store traffic while reducing shipping costs. Customers pick up online orders during lunch breaks or shopping trips.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Digital Platform Expansion:<\/strong> H&amp;M Home expanded its market beyond clothing. They leverage existing customer relationships to sell furniture and home decor online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their H&amp;M Club loyalty program tracks purchases across all channels. Members get early access to collaborations and personalized recommendations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Global Localization:<\/strong> H&amp;M adapts its online presence for local markets. Different countries see region-specific products, pricing, and marketing messages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Technology Investments:<\/strong> H&amp;M invested heavily in inventory management systems. Real-time stock visibility prevents overselling and enables efficient distribution between channels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Lessons<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Established brands can successfully transition to digital<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Omnichannel requires significant technology investment<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sustainability can differentiate in competitive markets<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Loyalty programs increase customer lifetime value<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group blog-tips\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong><em>Recommended Reading:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<style>.wp-block-kadence-iconlist.kt-svg-icon-list-items19628_49fe56-22:not(.this-stops-third-party-issues){margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;}.wp-block-kadence-iconlist.kt-svg-icon-list-items19628_49fe56-22 ul.kt-svg-icon-list:not(.this-prevents-issues):not(.this-stops-third-party-issues):not(.tijsloc){margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:var(--global-kb-spacing-sm, 1.5rem);margin-left:0px;}.wp-block-kadence-iconlist.kt-svg-icon-list-items19628_49fe56-22 ul.kt-svg-icon-list{grid-row-gap:5px;}.wp-block-kadence-iconlist.kt-svg-icon-list-items19628_49fe56-22 ul.kt-svg-icon-list .kt-svg-icon-list-item-wrap .kt-svg-icon-list-single{margin-right:10px;}.kt-svg-icon-list-items19628_49fe56-22 ul.kt-svg-icon-list .kt-svg-icon-list-level-0 .kt-svg-icon-list-single svg{font-size:20px;}<\/style>\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-iconlist kt-svg-icon-list-items kt-svg-icon-list-items19628_49fe56-22 kt-svg-icon-list-columns-1 alignnone\"><ul class=\"kt-svg-icon-list\"><style>.kt-svg-icon-list-item-19628_2b9db8-4e .kt-svg-icon-list-text mark.kt-highlight{background-color:unset;font-style:normal;color:#f76a0c;-webkit-box-decoration-break:clone;box-decoration-break:clone;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;}<\/style>\n<li class=\"wp-block-kadence-listitem kt-svg-icon-list-item-wrap kt-svg-icon-list-item-19628_2b9db8-4e\"><span class=\"kb-svg-icon-wrap kb-svg-icon-fe_checkCircle kt-svg-icon-list-single\"><svg viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"  fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\"  aria-hidden=\"true\"><path d=\"M22 11.08V12a10 10 0 1 1-5.93-9.14\"\/><polyline points=\"22 4 12 14.01 9 11.01\"\/><\/svg><\/span><span class=\"kt-svg-icon-list-text\"><strong><em><a href=\"https:\/\/6valley.app\/blog\/how-to-start-online-clothing-business\/\">How to Start Online Clothing Business: A Step-by-Step Guide<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n\n\n<style>.kt-svg-icon-list-item-19628_630d31-6c .kt-svg-icon-list-text mark.kt-highlight{background-color:unset;font-style:normal;color:#f76a0c;-webkit-box-decoration-break:clone;box-decoration-break:clone;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;}<\/style>\n<li class=\"wp-block-kadence-listitem kt-svg-icon-list-item-wrap kt-svg-icon-list-item-19628_630d31-6c\"><span class=\"kb-svg-icon-wrap kb-svg-icon-fe_checkCircle kt-svg-icon-list-single\"><svg viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"  fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\"  aria-hidden=\"true\"><path d=\"M22 11.08V12a10 10 0 1 1-5.93-9.14\"\/><polyline points=\"22 4 12 14.01 9 11.01\"\/><\/svg><\/span><span class=\"kt-svg-icon-list-text\"><strong><em><a href=\"https:\/\/6valley.app\/blog\/multi-vendor-ecommerce-marketplace-business\/\">How to Start A Multi Vendor eCommerce Marketplace Business?<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n\n\n<style>.kt-svg-icon-list-item-19628_ac4b85-0c .kt-svg-icon-list-text mark.kt-highlight{background-color:unset;font-style:normal;color:#f76a0c;-webkit-box-decoration-break:clone;box-decoration-break:clone;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;}<\/style>\n<li class=\"wp-block-kadence-listitem kt-svg-icon-list-item-wrap kt-svg-icon-list-item-19628_ac4b85-0c\"><span class=\"kb-svg-icon-wrap kb-svg-icon-fe_checkCircle kt-svg-icon-list-single\"><svg viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"  fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\"  aria-hidden=\"true\"><path d=\"M22 11.08V12a10 10 0 1 1-5.93-9.14\"\/><polyline points=\"22 4 12 14.01 9 11.01\"\/><\/svg><\/span><span class=\"kt-svg-icon-list-text\"><strong><em><a href=\"https:\/\/6valley.app\/blog\/how-to-grow-an-ecommerce-business\/\">How to Grow an Ecommerce Business: 10 Proven Strategies<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-bottom-line\">The Bottom Line<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The eCommerce fashion industry isn\u2019t just about selling clothes online;
