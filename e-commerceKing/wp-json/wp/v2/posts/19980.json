A study by Walker Sands found that 90% of online shoppers consider free shipping the biggest motivator for making a purchase online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can provide it for a limited time, for orders above a certain amount, or for first-time buyers. Promoting free delivery on banners, pop-ups, and product pages can encourage more purchases and increase order value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:<\/strong> A fashion store could run a \u201c<strong>Free Shipping This Weekend<\/strong>\u201d campaign for orders over $50, encouraging shoppers to add more items to reach the minimum and complete their purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9-abandoned-cart-recovery\">9.

Google Shopping Ads display products with images, making it easy for shoppers to browse and compare.<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>TikTok Ads:<\/strong> A great platform for brand discovery, especially among younger audiences.

Cross-Selling Opportunities<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cross-selling is a powerful strategy in fashion eCommerce to increase Average Order Value by recommending complementary products that complete a look or enhance the main purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the most effective cross-sell for fashion. Instead of just recommending similar items, you suggest everything needed to create a full outfit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to feature it clearly on the product page, like \u201cStyle it With\u201d or \u201cShop the Outfit\u201d, and also show it in the cart or checkout summary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Main Item: A dress. Cross-Sell: Matching shoes, a clutch bag, and a necklace.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Main Item: A blazer. Cross-Sell: The perfectly complementary shirt and trousers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Visuals: Use high-quality imagery of a model wearing the entire outfit to inspire the purchase.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"25-customer-support-training\">25. Customer Support Training<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well-trained customer support teams are essential for creating a positive shopping experience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teach staff to handle inquiries clearly, professionally, and empathetically, whether it\u2019s about product questions, orders, or returns. Equip them with knowledge about your products, policies, and common issues.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If a customer asked: <\/strong>Hi, the dress I ordered doesn\u2019t fit. Can I return it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Support Rep:<\/strong> Yes! Use our prepaid return label to send it back. Once we receive it, we\u2019ll process your refund.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Customer:<\/strong> Thanks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Support Rep:<\/strong> You\u2019re welcome!

Whether through email, social media, or website banners, clear and prompt updates make the shopping experience smoother and more engaging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"27-brand-awareness-recognition\">27.
