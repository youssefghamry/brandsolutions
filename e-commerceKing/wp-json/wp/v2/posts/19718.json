Common models include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Dropshipping<\/strong> \u2013 The seller offers products without holding inventory, while suppliers handle storage and shipping. This model carries low risk but yields smaller profit margins.<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wholesale\/Retail<\/strong> \u2013 The business buys products in bulk from manufacturers and resells them at a markup, allowing more control over pricing and branding.<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Private Labeling<\/strong> \u2013 The company sources products and applies its own brand label. Although costs are higher, it helps establish a stronger brand identity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Custom Manufacturing<\/strong> \u2013 The business designs and produces its own clothing line. This approach requires significant investment but provides full creative and quality control.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Print-on-Demand (POD) <\/strong>\u2013&nbsp; It allows you to sell custom products without keeping stock. Items are made after each order, keeping costs low and flexible, but profits are smaller, and customization is limited.<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Handmade\/Cut-and-Sew<\/strong> \u2013 You design and produce clothing yourself, usually in small batches.
