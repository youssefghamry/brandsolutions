But are all of them ideal contenders to be one of the greatest solutions in the market? I bet they don\u2019t. Remember I mentioned earlier that Active eCommerce CMS and 6Valley are excellent solutions? They have all the essential features an ideal content management system must inherit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here are the must-have features of an eCommerce solution:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-clean-customizable-code\">1. Clean &amp; Customizable Code<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you purchase any <strong>eCommerce solution<\/strong> (unless it is a SaaS product), you get the complete source code. An ideal eCommerce solution has to have a <strong>clean code structure<\/strong> with maximum customizable flexibility. If the codes are scattered and aren\u2019t customizable, you, as a developer, won\u2019t bother to purchase that script.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"659\" src=\"https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/6valley-cleand-and-customizable-code-1024x659.webp\" alt=\"6valley-cleand-and-customizable-code\" class=\"wp-image-14392\" srcset=\"https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/6valley-cleand-and-customizable-code-1024x659.webp 1024w, https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/6valley-cleand-and-customizable-code-300x193.webp 300w, https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/6valley-cleand-and-customizable-code-768x495.webp 768w, https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/6valley-cleand-and-customizable-code.webp 1090w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-easy-to-understand\">2. Easy-to-Understand<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not enough to be clean and <strong>customizable<\/strong>, it must be very <strong>well-organized<\/strong> and comment-proof. As someone else wrote the codes, you have no idea what intention or logic he had in mind, let\u2019s say, for a function everything has to be <strong>explained using comments<\/strong> (\/\/comments) because any developer can read &amp; understand this code. This is one of the biggest flairs of an excellent eCommerce code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-customer-support-system\">3. Customer Support System<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers are the heart of an eCommerce business. Everything you do is only for getting more and more customers on your system. So, an ideal eCommerce solution must have a customer support section to provide the utmost assistance. This support section can have a calling, messaging or ticket system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-separate-panels-for-different-users\">4. Separate Panels for Different Users<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If an eCommerce solution has <a href=\"https:\/\/6valley.app\/blog\/how-to-start-a-multi-vendor-ecommerce-marketplace-business\/\">multi vendor business model<\/a>, it should have different panels for sellers\/vendors. Sellers from the seller panel can manage their stores, orders, deliveries, etc. Unlike the admin panel, which has the master settings for everything in the business, the seller panel will only have settings that are related to stores.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"674\" src=\"https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/seller-panel.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-19057\" srcset=\"https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/seller-panel.webp 900w, https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/seller-panel-300x225.webp 300w, https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/seller-panel-768x575.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"528\" src=\"https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/admin-wallet.webp\" alt=\"admin wallet\" class=\"wp-image-19060\" srcset=\"https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/admin-wallet.webp 900w, https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/admin-wallet-300x176.webp 300w, https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/admin-wallet-768x451.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-product-management\">5. Product Management<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An ideal eCommerce CMS needs to have a solid product management system. Admin, as well as sellers, can manage their products right from their respective panels. All product-related features, such as product add, delete products, create SKUs, bulk import\/export, manage categories &amp; sub-categories, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-order-management\">6. Order Management<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An ideal eCommerce CMS must have an organized order management system. Everything related to orders must be in one place or nearby. It helps users easily navigate through necessary order-related sections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7-delivery-management\">7. Delivery Management<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a strong delivery system is crucial for an eCommerce solution. If the delivery process isn&#8217;t reliable, all your efforts in ordering products will be in vain. So, it&#8217;s important to have a solid delivery system, whether managed by the admin or individual sellers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"533\" src=\"https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/delivery-management.webp\" alt=\"Delivery Management\" class=\"wp-image-19043\" srcset=\"https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/delivery-management.webp 900w, https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/delivery-management-300x178.webp 300w, https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/delivery-management-768x455.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8-ratings-reviews\">8. Ratings &amp; Reviews<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ratings &amp; reviews are things that customers look for while shopping from an eCommerce website. If you find an eCommerce solution that doesn\u2019t come with this feature, you should look somewhere else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9-promotion-management\">9. Promotion Management<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Promotion is a crucial element of a business. It attracts more customers and brings more sales. More or less, every eCommerce solution has promotional management. However, check if a system has multiple banners, announcement sections, popup banners, coupons, different sale campaigns and push notification features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"10-multiple-secure-payment-methods\">10. Multiple Secure Payment Methods<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every eCommerce business must have multiple payment methods, as it ensures no customers return empty-handed just because of not having their preferred payment methods. Multiple payment methods include digital payments (with different payment gateways), virtual wallet payments, cash on deliveries, offline payments, etc. Not only are multiple payments enough, these payment methods must be 100% secure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"395\" src=\"https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/payment-gateways.webp\" alt=\"Multiple Secure Payment Methods\" class=\"wp-image-19059\" srcset=\"https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/payment-gateways.webp 900w, https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/payment-gateways-300x132.webp 300w, https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/payment-gateways-768x337.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"11-attractive-user-interface\">11. Attractive User Interface<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A beautiful user interface with an <strong>excellent user experience<\/strong> is always welcomed by all. As attractive UI is soothing to the eyes, well-constructed UX helps users have everything within reach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"12-compatibility\">12. Compatibility<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An eCommerce solution must be highly adaptable. What it means, any small or large business can easily fit within the CMS. Not only that, it should have the adaptability of different businesses like electronics, lifestyle, grocery, etc. As I mentioned about the electronics business, it should have the option to sell digital products, such as software, licenses, subscriptions, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"13-report-analytics\">13. Report &amp; Analytics<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Reports and analytics are the data that show how a business performs. An eCommerce solution must have different sales reports, such as earning reports, sales reports, transaction reports, product reports, order reports, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Report-and-analytics.webp\" alt=\"Report &amp; Analytics\" class=\"wp-image-19058\" srcset=\"https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Report-and-analytics.webp 900w, https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Report-and-analytics-300x179.webp 300w, https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Report-and-analytics-768x459.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"14-supporting-mobile-apps\">14. Supporting Mobile Apps<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a separate mobile app for different users, such as customer app, seller app, deliveryman app, etc., is a great initiative. It ensures ultimate mobility for all users in the system. Not only that, all <a href=\"https:\/\/6valley.app\/blog\/best-multi-vendor-ecommerce-app\/\">eCommerce mobile apps<\/a> should be cross-platform supported so that anyone from any platform can use those apps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/supporting-mobile-apps.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-19038\" srcset=\"https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/supporting-mobile-apps.webp 900w, https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/supporting-mobile-apps-300x111.webp 300w, https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/supporting-mobile-apps-768x285.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"15-user-management\">15. User Management<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An eCommerce business has multiple users, such as customers, sellers, deliverymen, employees, etc. An ideal eCommerce system must have a proper user management system so the admin can manage them to provide maximum user benefits.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"532\" src=\"https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/user-management.webp\" alt=\"User Management\" class=\"wp-image-19039\" srcset=\"https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/user-management.webp 900w, https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/user-management-300x177.webp 300w, https:\/\/6valley.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/user-management-768x454.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the must-have features of a great eCommerce solution.
