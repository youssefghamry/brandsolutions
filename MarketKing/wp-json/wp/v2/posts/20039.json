They&#8217;re popular because they&#8217;re simple to understand and can be applied to many items. For example, a 20% off a $50 product means the customer saves $10.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fixed-amount-discounts\">Fixed Amount Discounts<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A fixed-amount discount is a straightforward and popular way to offer savings to your customers. With this type of discount, a specific amount is subtracted from the total price of a product or order.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re selling an item for $50 and offer a $10 discount, the customer pays just $40.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike percentage-based discounts, a fixed amount clearly shows the savings upfront. Businesses often use these discounts and offers to attract new customers, clear out old stock, or encourage bulk purchases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"free-shipping\">Free Shipping<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Free shipping is an effective eCommerce promotion that encourages customers to complete purchases by removing extra checkout costs. It attracts more shoppers and increases average order values.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This promotion can be used as a limited-time offer, part of a loyalty program, or for specific products. Free shipping helps eCommerce stores improve customer satisfaction, build loyalty, and increase conversions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"flash-sales\">Flash Sales<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Flash sales are time-limited promotions where products are offered at a significant discount for a short period (often just a few hours or a day). This creates a sense of urgency which encourages customers to make quick purchases before the deal expires. Flash sales can help businesses clear out inventory, attract new customers, and boost sales during slow periods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"seasonal-promotions\">Seasonal Promotions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Seasonal promotions are discounts or special eCommerce offers for specific times of the year, like holidays or events. These sales take advantage of the increased shopping activity during these periods. For example, stores might offer Black Friday deals or holiday discounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seasonal promotions encourage customers to act quickly and help businesses clear out inventory.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"first-time-customer-offers\">First-Time Customer Offers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First-time customer offers give new buyers a special discount or deal on their first purchase.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They might be a percentage off, a fixed discount, or free shipping.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These promotions encourage hesitant shoppers to buy by offering an incentive. They also leave a positive first impression, making customers more likely to return.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"bogo\">BOGO<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>BOGO (Buy One, Get One) is a popular promotion where customers get a free or discounted item when they buy one at full price. It\u2019s a simple and attractive offer that encourages people to buy more.<br><br>For example, if a customer buys one shirt, they might get a second one for free or at a reduced price. BOGO deals can help businesses move inventory, attract new customers, and increase sales.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"loyalty-rewards\">Loyalty Rewards<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to traditional discount campaigns, offering loyalty rewards or referral discounts can also boost your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Loyalty rewards are incentives given to customers for making repeat purchases or engaging with a brand over time. These rewards can include discounts, points, free products, or exclusive offers.<br><br>The goal is to encourage customers to keep coming back by showing appreciation for their continued support.<br><br>Loyalty programs help businesses build stronger relationships with customers and increase repeat sales. They also make customers feel valued, which can lead to better retention and more word-of-mouth promotion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"referral-discounts\">Referral Discounts<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Referral discounts encourage customers to refer friends or family to a business in exchange for a reward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a new customer makes a purchase using a referral code or link, both the referrer and the new customer receive a discount or other benefits. Referral discounts are effective because people trust recommendations from friends and family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"birthday-anniversary-deals\">Birthday\/Anniversary Deals<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Birthday and anniversary deals are special offers given to customers on their special days.. These deals can include discounts, free gifts, or exclusive offers as a way to celebrate and show appreciation. Customers often tend to shop during these promotions, as they enjoy the personal touch and exclusive rewards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"bundle-offers\">Bundle Offers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bundle offers allow customers to purchase multiple related products together at a discounted price.<br><br>This strategy increases the average order value while giving customers a sense of savings. It\u2019s also a great way to move slow-selling items by pairing them with bestsellers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"giveaways\">Giveaways<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Giveaways involve offering products or services for free through contests, draws, or promotional campaigns. Boost your brand visibility, grow your audience (especially on social media), and engage potential customers by creating excitement and urgency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"coupons\">Coupons<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Coupons provide customers with a discount or special deal, usually in the form of a code or digital voucher.<br><br>They\u2019re highly effective for driving quick conversions, re-engaging past buyers, and rewarding loyal customers with exclusive offers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"20-e-commerce-promotion-management-strategies\">20 eCommerce Promotion Management Strategies<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The right promotion management strategies can help you attract more customers, increase engagement, and maximize ROI.

Let\u2019s take a deeper look.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"campaign-management\">Campaign Management<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>MarketKing is a multi-vendor eCommerce platform with advanced campaign tools to boost revenue and customer engagement. Admins can create module-specific campaigns tailored to stores or products. This helps businesses target customers effectively.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>MarketKing offers two main types of campaigns to help businesses increase sales and customer engagement- Basic Campaigns and Item Campaigns&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"basic-campaigns\">Basic Campaigns<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Basic campaigns allow admins to highlight specific offers or discounts to attract more customers. The &#8220;Add New Campaign&#8221; section includes fields like title, description, start and end dates, as well as start and end times for the campaign. This feature enables admins to highlight discounts, exclusive offers and other promotional deals effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"601\" height=\"355\" src=\"https:\/\/marketking.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/basic-campaigns.webp\" alt=\"Basic Campaigns\" class=\"wp-image-20049\" srcset=\"https:\/\/marketking.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/basic-campaigns.webp 601w, https:\/\/marketking.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/basic-campaigns-300x177.webp 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"item-campaigns\">Item Campaigns<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Item campaigns are more targeted and focus on specific products or services. Admins can select individual items from stores and offer discounts or special promotions. For example, the &#8220;Grocery&#8221; module has fields like Item Info, Item Details, Amount, Attribute, and Time Schedule. In other modules (Pharmacy, Shop, Food), the &#8220;Item Campaigns&#8221; feature includes some similar fields along with a few additional ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"601\" height=\"920\" src=\"https:\/\/marketking.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/add-new-campaign.webp\" alt=\"Item Campaigns\" class=\"wp-image-20048\" srcset=\"https:\/\/marketking.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/add-new-campaign.webp 601w, https:\/\/marketking.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/add-new-campaign-196x300.webp 196w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"banners\">Banners<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The admin can easily create and manage banners for products and stores.
