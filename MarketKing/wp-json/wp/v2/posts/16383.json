If it were before COVID-19, I might have gone to a pharmacy or medical store, even in the heavy rain, to get the medicine. But this time, I did the opposite. I sat in the comfort of my home, unlocked my phone, ordered the medicines, and within a few minutes, my doorbell rang!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, the rise of online medicine delivery apps in India has increased immensely. In 2025, people are using these apps for a seamless, time-saving and convenient experience.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of businessmen and entrepreneurs are taking advantage of this leading industry. So, there are plenty of options for apps for medicine.

It\u2019s helpful for people who are sick, elderly, or just too busy to visit a pharmacy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s how these apps help:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Easy Ordering:<\/strong> You can order prescriptions by uploading a picture or find over-the-counter medicines quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Delivered to Your Door:<\/strong> Your medication comes right to your house, saving you a trip to the pharmacy. You can often track your order to see when it will arrive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Save Time and Money:<\/strong> You save time not having to travel or wait in lines. Some apps also offer discounts or deals on your medicines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Convenient and Private:<\/strong> It&#8217;s super convenient for busy people or if you can&#8217;t easily leave home. Your orders are also handled privately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Safe and Trustworthy:<\/strong> Good medicine delivery apps work with real pharmacies and follow rules to make sure your drugs are safe and real.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As internet usage increases in India, the demand for online medicine delivery apps is also rising. These apps are convenient and save a lot of time. According to Statista, experts predict the market to reach US$81.37bn by 2028, indicating a huge potential for business in this field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For business owners and entrepreneurs, it\u2019s also a great idea to launch such an app. The demand is high, and many software solutions are available to get started fast and affordably.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"613\" data-id=\"22904\" src=\"https:\/\/marketking.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/medicine-delivery-app.webp\" alt=\"Online Medicine Delivery App\" class=\"wp-image-22904\" srcset=\"https:\/\/marketking.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/medicine-delivery-app.webp 900w, https:\/\/marketking.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/medicine-delivery-app-300x204.webp 300w, https:\/\/marketking.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/medicine-delivery-app-768x523.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"must-have-features-of-an-online-medicine-delivery-app\">Must-Have Features of an Online Medicine Delivery App<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before choosing and diving deep into the details of top <strong>online medicine delivery<\/strong> apps, it\u2019s better to know the <a href=\"https:\/\/marketking.app\/features\/\">must have features<\/a> that the app should include. This way you have a clear idea of what you need and what you should expect from an app that you\u2019re installing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a user, the first thing that we should look for is reliability, ease of use and prompt delivery services. Now let\u2019s get into the details of the features:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"set-location\">Set location<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the customers can\u2019t find their nearby stores and get the medicines on time, what\u2019s the point of using a medicine delivery app?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This feature helps customers to discover nearby pharmacies or medical stores based on the location they set. Also, this feature gives a personalized shopping experience, saving time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiple-payment-method\">Multiple Payment Method<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If as a customer you want to pay digitally and find no option for digital payment on the app would you still use it? Honestly, as a user, I won\u2019t.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having multiple payment methods makes a business look trustworthy. An app with multiple payment methods will ensure that all the customers are served properly with a lower cart abandonment rate.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Businesses always try to make sure their customers feel safe using the service while launching their medicine delivery app. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiple-languages\">Multiple languages<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everyone is a multi-lingual person. In particular elderly people or senior citizens who need to buy medicine using an app might face difficulty due to a foreign language. Integrated multiple language systems in the app will give the users a personalized experience and help them navigate easily.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"search-and-filtration\">Search and Filtration<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having an accurate in-app search option can elevate the user experience for a medicine delivery mobile app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suppose your grandfather needs a particular medicine, and you\u2019re scrolling through thousands of options from the app to find the one you need. Wouldn\u2019t it be frustrating? Instead of manual scrolling wouldn\u2019t it be better to have a search option where you would just start typing, and the autocomplete would do its magic?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"social-login\">Social Login<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you remember all your passwords, or do you write them down somewhere just in case you forget? Isn\u2019t it a hassle to keep the paper safe where you\u2019ve written your password? This is why a social login system in an app can be incredibly helpful. With this system, you won&#8217;t have to worry about creating a new account from scratch or remembering passwords separately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wishlist\">Wishlist<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Picture this: You&#8217;re browsing a pharmacy app and come across an item that you might need in the future. But there&#8217;s no way to save it for later. Frustrating, right? That&#8217;s why having a &#8220;wishlist&#8221; feature is a good idea. With this feature, you can effortlessly save items you\u2019re interested in and return them later. Mobile medicine developers use it to make their customers happy and encourage them to return to your app for future purchases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"order-tracking\">Order Tracking<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>How long will you wait for your medicine to come to your doorstep? Forever? No!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, it\u2019s a customer\u2019s right to know the order progress. The mobile application should have a live order tracking feature, updating users on the delivery status.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"live-chat\">Live Chat<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, customers order the wrong medicines or forget to add an important one to the cart before proceeding. Also, they might need to talk with the deliveryman for any delivery-related issues. For this reason, having a live chat option is essential for quick and convenient communication between customers and deliverymen or sellers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wallet-and-loyalty-points\">Wallet and Loyalty Points<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a loyal customer of a certain app, you should have some perks like a wallet and loyalty points option. This option will not only enhance your shopping experience but also will value your loyalty to the app (a user\u2019s loyalty to the app.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"notifications\">Notifications<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the app is running a campaign, exclusive deals, sales, or exciting offers, it should notify the users. This way the users will get medicine at a great deal and encourage their loyalty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted has-base-2-background-color has-background\"><strong>Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/marketking.app\/blog\/e-pharmacy-market-in-india\/\">ePharmacy Market in India<\/a><\/strong><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"quick-glance-of-best-online-medicine-delivery-apps-in-india\">Quick Glance of Best Online Medicine Delivery Apps in India &#8211; <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if you\u2019re looking for the best online pharmacy app in India and need a quick view before going into the details, you can check the table below &#8211;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Apps Name<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Founded<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>User-Rating<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Delivery Time (Approximate)\u00a0<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Subscription Plans<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Tata 1Mg<\/strong><\/td><td>2015<\/td><td>4.7 Out of 5<\/td><td>Same-day in metros<\/td><td>6 Months Plan &#8211; \u20b9 275<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>MediBuddy<\/strong><\/td><td>2013<\/td><td>4.5 Out of 5<\/td><td>24 &#8211; 48 hours<\/td><td>MB vHealth Platinum Family &#8211; \u20b9 12000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>PharmEasy<\/strong><\/td><td>2015<\/td><td>4.4 Out of 5<\/td><td>1 &#8211; 7 business days&nbsp;<\/td><td>PharmEasy Plus (Spending-Based Pricing)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Netmeds<\/strong><\/td><td>2010<\/td><td>4.3 Out of 5<\/td><td>Within 24 hours&nbsp;<\/td><td>12-Month Netmeds First Membership &#8211; \u20b9 499<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Apollo 247<\/strong><\/td><td>2020<\/td><td>4.3 Out of 5<\/td><td>Less than 24 hours<\/td><td>Circle Membership &#8211; \u20b9199\/12 Months Plan<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"top-5-industry-leading-online-medicine-delivery-apps\">Top 5 Industry-Leading Online Medicine Delivery Apps<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this section, we will look at the top 5 <strong>online medicine delivery<\/strong> apps in India that you can consider installing and using to make your healthcare-related product purchasing journey much easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-tata-1-mg\">1.

If you\u2019re someone who wants to build or launch the fastest medicine delivery app, you need to do careful consideration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not just a user-facing app. It requires an admin panel, a pharmacy store application and panel, and a deliveryman app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-1-define-your-unique-value-proposition\">Step 1:&nbsp; Define your unique value proposition<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this step, outline your goals and unique offerings for your target customers in the healthcare market.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-2-market-analysis\">Step 2: Market Analysis<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Analysis and test the existing apps in the market to get a clear idea of where they are lacking and how you can fill up the void in the market.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-3-team-building\">Step 3: Team Building<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a successful application and system requires a dedicated and hard-working team. Below are the examples of team members that you need to build your own team for launching an <strong>online medicine delivery<\/strong> app &#8211;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Project Manager<\/strong><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Frontend Developers<\/strong><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Backend Developers<\/strong><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>UI\/UX Designers<\/strong><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>QA Testers<\/strong><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Marketing Team&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Database Administrator<\/strong><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Business Research Analyst<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-4-choosing-the-right-technology-stack\">Step 4: Choosing the right technology stack<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019re not only just building or launching a mere app, but you\u2019re also building an entire system to run the online delivery service smoothly through the app. For that reason, you need to choose the appropriate technology stack based on requirements.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need detailed guidance on how to choose the <a href=\"https:\/\/marketking.app\/blog\/best-tech-stack-for-ecommerce-business-website\/\">best technology stack<\/a> for free.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-5-develop-a-prototype\">Step 5: Develop a Prototype<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A prototype will help you visualize the whole system before moving for the entire development process. In this stage, you will be able to change requirements and add new features if needed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-6-development-phase\">Step 6: Development Phase<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this step, start developing your applications by dividing them into manageable sprints for iterative improvements.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-7-feature-integration\">Step 7: Feature Integration<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Integrate features like authentication, prescription upload, and multiple payment gateway for a seamless user experience from your mobile application.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-8-security-and-compliance\">Step 8: Security and Compliance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to handling sensitive medical data, it is important to prioritize security and ensure that all healthcare regulations are being followed. This means implementing robust encryption protocols to safeguard against unauthorized access and conducting thorough security audits to identify any vulnerabilities. By taking these steps, you can help to ensure that patient data remains safe, secure, and protected at all times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-9-testing-and-quality-assurance\">Step 9: Testing and Quality Assurance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For this step, your QA team will rigorously test the app, its functions, and its usability. If any issue comes up, they address it, and developers try to resolve it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-10-ready-for-launching\">Step 10: Ready for Launching&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After completing the whole development process, your app is ready to launch. In this step, try to get help from your marketing team to create a buzz about your app to your target audience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to building a medicine order app, careful planning and a dedicated team are essential. Building an app from scratch requires paying team members for each update or change, but this ensures that your app remains up-to-date and functional. However, if you hire freelancers to build your app initially, you may not be able to rely on the same person for future updates or changes, the person who worked in the initial level of development.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then what can be the solution for this? Well, there exists a readymade solution that can be proven as the best and eye-opening solution for anyone who wants to launch their own online medicine delivery app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted has-base-2-background-color has-background\"><strong>Read: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketking.app\/blog\/e-pharmacy-business-models\/\"><strong>e-Pharmacy Business Models<\/strong><\/a><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a-readymade-solution-for-launching-your-online-medicine-delivery-app\">A Readymade Solution for Launching Your Online Medicine Delivery App\u00a0<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/marketking.app\/\">MarketKing<\/a> is a multi-vendor and multi-module online eCommerce business solution that lets one operate businesses in different sectors from one central control dashboard.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"476\" src=\"https:\/\/marketking.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/marketking.webp\" alt=\"MarketKing\" class=\"wp-image-22465\" srcset=\"https:\/\/marketking.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/marketking.webp 900w, https:\/\/marketking.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/marketking-300x159.webp 300w, https:\/\/marketking.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/marketking-768x406.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n<style>.wp-block-kadence-advancedbtn.kb-btns16383_d97c28-33{gap:var(--global-kb-gap-xs, 0.5rem );justify-content:center;align-items:center;}.kt-btns16383_d97c28-33 .kt-button{font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;}.kt-btns16383_d97c28-33 .kt-btn-wrap-0{margin-right:5px;}.wp-block-kadence-advancedbtn.kt-btns16383_d97c28-33 .kt-btn-wrap-0 .kt-button{color:#555555;border-color:#555555;}.wp-block-kadence-advancedbtn.kt-btns16383_d97c28-33 .kt-btn-wrap-0 .kt-button:hover, .wp-block-kadence-advancedbtn.kt-btns16383_d97c28-33 .kt-btn-wrap-0 .kt-button:focus{color:#ffffff;border-color:#444444;}.wp-block-kadence-advancedbtn.kt-btns16383_d97c28-33 .kt-btn-wrap-0 .kt-button::before{display:none;}.wp-block-kadence-advancedbtn.kt-btns16383_d97c28-33 .kt-btn-wrap-0 .kt-button:hover, .wp-block-kadence-advancedbtn.kt-btns16383_d97c28-33 .kt-btn-wrap-0 .kt-button:focus{background:#444444;}<\/style>\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-advancedbtn kb-buttons-wrap kb-btns16383_d97c28-33\"><style>ul.menu .wp-block-kadence-advancedbtn .kb-btn16383_55cb35-be.kb-button{width:initial;}<\/style><a class=\"kb-button kt-button button kb-btn16383_55cb35-be kt-btn-size-standard kt-btn-width-type-auto kb-btn-global-fill kt-btn-has-text-true kt-btn-has-svg-false  wp-block-kadence-singlebtn\" href=\"https:\/\/1.envato.market\/NkBy0v\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"kt-btn-inner-text\"><strong>Get MarketKing Now<\/strong><\/span><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes with the module of Pharmacy along with Food, Parcel, Shop and Grocery.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you want to focus solely on launching your online medicine delivery app, you can take advantage of the \u201cPharmacy\u201d module of MarketKing.
