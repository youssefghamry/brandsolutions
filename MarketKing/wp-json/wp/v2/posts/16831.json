The whole scenario before and after the pandemic changed due to several factors. The ePharmacy companies worked as a lifeline for their consumers during the pandemic and created opportunities for startups to take hold of their businesses.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the section below, we will look at the driving factors behind the growth of ePharmacy in India &#8211;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Adaptation of Digital Technology&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, the Internet has become a vital part of everyday life in India. With the increasing penetration of smartphones and internet connectivity, more people, including those in rural areas, are gaining access to digital platforms.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, online services like ordering medicines and consulting with healthcare providers have become increasingly popular, particularly among those who find it difficult to access traditional healthcare facilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital literacy is on the rise in India, and this has contributed to a growing demand for online healthcare services, including ePharmacy. The country has seen a surge in the number of startups offering ePharmacy options, providing consumers with a wide range of choices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The government&#8217;s flagship program, &#8220;Digital India,&#8221; aims to empower society digitally, and it has had a significant impact on the way people buy medicines online. With more people using digital platforms to access healthcare services, it is clear that the trend towards ePharmacy is set to continue.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Rise in Chronic Disease Due to Changing Lifestyle&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disorders have been on the rise among people living in India. One of the main reasons behind this is the changing lifestyle of people and the lack of awareness of these diseases.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Managing these conditions requires regular medication &#8211; which creates a steady demand for prescription drugs. And the most convenient way to get this on a routine basis is through ePharmacy.<br><br>ePharmacy platforms address this need by offering a convenient solution for patients to access their medications and manage their health conditions from the comfort of their homes. So even if someone cannot walk or at their old age, using ePharmacy service can solve their issue, providing a great scope for entrepreneurs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Changing Consumer Preferences<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In today&#8217;s fast-paced world, convenience and flexibility have become top priorities for consumers. And when it comes to healthcare, these preferences are no different. That&#8217;s where ePharmacy platforms come in &#8211; they offer the perfect solution to busy schedules and long waiting times at pharmacies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the option of doorstep delivery of medications and online consultations with healthcare professionals, patients can now enjoy the flexibility of getting all their medications without the need to step outside their homes. This saves time and effort and ensures patients&#8217; safety, especially during difficult times.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Expansion of Healthcare Infrastructure<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Better logistics and technology have made medicine delivery faster and more efficient. The growth of ePharmacy has been made possible by improvements in the infrastructure that make it easier to scale up operations. This means that companies can now reach more customers in both urban and rural areas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Competitive Pricing, Discounts, and Transparency&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers are increasingly choosing ePharmacy businesses to save money on their medications. These online retailers offer discounts, coupons, and loyalty programs and provide transparent and up-to-date pricing information. This makes the whole system more trustworthy and acceptable to customers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Enhanced Patient Care<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many medical apps provide helpful features such as medication reminders, dosage instructions, and access to digital health records. These features can help people manage their health conditions more effectively.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, online consultations with qualified healthcare professionals can improve patient engagement and ensure medication is managed appropriately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Government Initiatives<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Indian government has launched several initiatives to promote digital healthcare and enhance access to medical services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the initiatives, these are the remarkable ones to mention:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Universal Immunisation Programme<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>National Iron Plus Initiative for Anaemia Control<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>National Programme for the Health Care for the Elderly (NPHCE)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>National Programme for Prevention &amp; Management of Burn Injuries (NPPMBI)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>National Oral Health programme<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These favorable initiatives, regulations, and policies support the growth of ePharmacy companies, encouraging investment and innovation in the sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><strong>Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/marketking.app\/blog\/e-pharmacy-business-models\/\">e-Pharmacy Business Model<\/a><\/strong><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-market-share-of-major-players\">Market Share of Key e-Pharmacy companies operating in India&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to the giants in the industry of ePharmacy in India, market-dominating companies like Tata 1Mg, Apollo 247, PharmEasy, and Netmeds are the go-to destinations for millions of customers seeking reliable and convenient healthcare solutions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about the market share of each of these giants, let&#8217;s take a closer look below-<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"901\" height=\"525\" src=\"https:\/\/marketking.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/market-share-of-epharmacyccompanies-in-india.webp\" alt=\"Market Share of Key ePharmacy companies operating in India \" class=\"wp-image-16832\" srcset=\"https:\/\/marketking.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/market-share-of-epharmacyccompanies-in-india.webp 901w, https:\/\/marketking.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/market-share-of-epharmacyccompanies-in-india-300x175.webp 300w, https:\/\/marketking.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/market-share-of-epharmacyccompanies-in-india-768x448.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Market share of ePharmacy companies in India (as of September 2023)&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><strong>Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/marketking.app\/blog\/best-online-medicine-delivery-apps-in-india\/\">Best Online Medicine Delivery Apps in India<\/a><\/strong><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-trends-used-in-epharmacy\">Role of Technological Advancement in ePharmacy<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Technological advancement has played a significant role in expanding the ePharmacy market in India.
