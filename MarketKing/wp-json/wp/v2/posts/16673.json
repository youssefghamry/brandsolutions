As he was tired of going back &amp; forth after his internship he thought of doing something to solve this issue. Suddenly the idea of starting an online pharmacy came to his mind. But he had no idea how the e-Pharmacy Business Model works!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re like Jay or just someone who needs details of this growing industry and the models working behind this, you just came to the right place.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the projected market value of e-pharmacy in India is US$649.50m by 2028, the possibilities are huge for businesses.

Instead of going to a physical pharmacy, you easily order your prescribed medicine and medical supplies through the e-pharmacy website or app, and they&#8217;re delivered to your door. It&#8217;s convenient, fast, and accessible, especially for those with busy schedules or limited mobility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Different Kinds of e-Pharmacy Business Models<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before diving into being a part of any business, it\u2019s wise to do the groundwork. The same goes for any online pharmacy store. An in-depth knowledge of different business models will help you identify what you want to adopt and run your business with.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two main types of e-pharmacy business models. Each of these comes with its own intent, advantages, and drawbacks.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"513\" height=\"752\" src=\"https:\/\/marketking.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/e-pharmacy-business-model-inforgraph.webp\" alt=\"Different Kinds of e-Pharmacy Business Models\" class=\"wp-image-16683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/marketking.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/e-pharmacy-business-model-inforgraph.webp 513w, https:\/\/marketking.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/e-pharmacy-business-model-inforgraph-205x300.webp 205w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Inventory-Based Model&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply, it is the online version of traditional brick-and-mortar stores.
