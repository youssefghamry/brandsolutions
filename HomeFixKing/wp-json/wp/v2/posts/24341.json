It covers how you get customers, what you charge, and how you deliver your service.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your business model shapes everything, like your schedule, your income, and how fast you grow. The right business model gives you control, profit, and freedom.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many handyman businesses today also fall under the broader home services category, especially as more services shift online. For this, modern handyman businesses often integrate technology through an app business model, connecting directly with customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"900\" src=\"https:\/\/demandium.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/handyman-business.webp\" alt=\"Handyman Business\" class=\"wp-image-24343\" srcset=\"https:\/\/demandium.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/handyman-business.webp 900w, https:\/\/demandium.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/handyman-business-300x300.webp 300w, https:\/\/demandium.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/handyman-business-150x150.webp 150w, https:\/\/demandium.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/handyman-business-768x768.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-is-choosing-the-right-handyman-business-model-important\">Why is Choosing the Right Handyman Business Model Important?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your handyman services business model decides how you earn, who you serve, and how you grow. Without a clear model, it&#8217;s easy to lose money, waste time, or struggle with the wrong clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The right model helps you price better, plan smarter, and offer services people actually want. It also makes it easier to market your services and scale later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you want to work solo, run a team, or build an on-demand app, your model is the base of everything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-are-the-main-types-of-handyman-business-models\">What are the Main Types of Handyman Business Models?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few main types of handyman business models. Each one works in its own way. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the most common ones to help you with choosing the right business model for your handyman service &#8211;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solo Handyman Model:<\/strong> This is when one person runs the entire business. They handle all the work themselves. It\u2019s simple and low-cost to start. The solo handyman sets their own schedule and chooses jobs they feel comfortable doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Team-Based Handyman Model:<\/strong> In this model, the handyman hires a small team. This allows them to take on bigger or more complex jobs. A team can get more work done in less time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Franchise Model:<\/strong> Some handymen join a franchise instead of starting from scratch. A franchise provides a brand name and business system. This can make it easier to find customers. But the handyman must follow the franchise\u2019s rules. They also pay fees to the franchise company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Specialized Handyman Model:<\/strong> This model focuses on specific types of jobs. For example, a handyman might only do electrical work or painting. By specializing, they can charge more because they\u2019re seen as an expert.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Subscription Handyman Model:<\/strong> In this approach, customers pay a regular fee for ongoing services. For example, a handyman might visit monthly to check for maintenance issues. This creates steady income. It also builds strong relationships with clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Platform-Based Model:<\/strong> In this model, a business owner runs a marketplace or app where customers book handymen. They connect the two sides and earn from service fees or commissions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-top-handyman-service-business-models\">6 Top Handyman Service Business Models<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have a brief idea about the handyman business models, let\u2019s break down each one in detail. This way, you can clearly see how they work, what they offer, and which one fits your goals best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"solo-handyman-model\">Solo Handyman Model<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the simplest way to get started. You run the business on your own. That means taking client calls, doing the work, handling payments &#8211; everything. There\u2019s no need to hire employees or split profits. You can set your rates and choose jobs based on your skills and comfort level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To implement this model, you\u2019ll need basic tools, a reliable vehicle, and a way to find customers either through social media, a website, or onboarding as a service provider in an existing handyman service app. Many handymen start this way because it\u2019s low-cost and flexible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Low startup cost<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Full control of your schedule<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Personal connection with clients<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Limited by how much work you can handle alone<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>No backup if you\u2019re sick or busy<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You have to do all the business tasks, not just the repairs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who is this suitable for:<\/strong> This model works best for individuals who are self-motivated, enjoy working independently. Newcomers, part-time workers, or skilled individuals wanting full control over a small business can go for this one.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"team-based-handyman-model\">Team-Based Handyman Model<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This model is about growing bigger. You hire other handymen to work for your business. You might still do some hands-on work, or you might focus on managing the team and getting new clients.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this process, you can take on bigger or more complex jobs like home renovations or large-scale repairs. As jobs come in, you assign tasks based on team strengths. Having a team means you can complete projects faster and serve more customers at once. It helps grow your client base without burning out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Can handle larger and more profitable projects<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Faster turnaround time for customers<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Easier to grow the business<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Higher costs for wages, tools, and insurance<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Managing people adds responsibility<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Risk of inconsistent work quality if not managed well<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who is this suitable for:<\/strong> Experienced handymen ready to grow, or small business owners managing multiple service types. This model is also ideal for someone who has experience in the business, enjoys leadership, and wants to scale their existing business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"franchise-handyman-model\">Franchise Handyman Model<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With this model, you buy the right to use a well-known handyman brand. Think of it like buying a ready-made business. You get to use their name, their way of doing things, and their marketing materials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joining a handyman franchise means you\u2019re part of a bigger brand. The franchise provides you with a business name, marketing support, training, and a system to follow. Customers trust well-known brands, so finding clients can be easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To implement this, you\u2019ll need to pay an upfront franchise fee and ongoing royalties. You\u2019ll also need to follow the franchise\u2019s rules and guidelines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Built-in brand recognition attracts customers<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Access to training and support<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Marketing is handled by the franchise<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>High startup and ongoing costs<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Less flexibility in how you run your business<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Profits are shared with the franchise company<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who is this suitable for: <\/strong>People who want to own a business but prefer a structured path with a proven brand, training, and ongoing support.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"specialized-handyman-model\">Specialized Handyman Model<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This model focuses on one specific type of service. For example, you might only do electrical work, carpentry, or tile installation. By specializing, you position yourself as an expert in that area. Customers are willing to pay more for specialized skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For successful implementation, you\u2019ll need to master your chosen skill and market yourself as an expert. You might also need certifications or licenses depending on the service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Higher earning potential due to expertise<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Attracts customers looking for specific solutions<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Builds a strong reputation in one niche<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>More efficient operations<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Misses out on other types of work<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Limited customer base if the niche is too small<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Requires continuous learning to stay updated<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Income depends on the demand for that skill<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who is this suitable for: <\/strong>This model suits individuals who are highly skilled in one area and passionate about mastering it. It\u2019s perfect for someone who enjoys deepening their expertise rather than being a jack-of-all-trades.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subscription-handyman-model\">Subscription Handyman Model<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This subscription-based model works like a membership. Customers pay you a regular fee, perhaps every month or every three months. In return, they get certain services or a set number of hours of work. It&#8217;s often for ongoing maintenance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll need to set up a system for managing subscriptions and staying organized if you go for this model. You\u2019ll also need to offer clear value to justify the recurring fee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using this model, you get predictable income, and customers enjoy peace of mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Recurring revenue stream<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Easier to manage bookings<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Strong long-term client relationships<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Needs upfront trust to get signups<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Must deliver services on time<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Managing multiple subscriptions is tricky without tools<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who is this suitable for: <\/strong>Handymen with an existing client base, or those offering general maintenance in upscale neighborhoods or gated communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"platform-based-handyman-model\">Platform-Based Handyman Model<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this model, you create or run an app or website where customers can book local handymen for their repair or maintenance needs. You don\u2019t do the actual repairs yourself. Instead, your role is to connect customers with skilled handymen in their area. You earn money through listing fees, subscription charges for handymen, or commissions on each booking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this model, you\u2019ll need to invest in building a user-friendly platform (app or website) that allows customers to easily find and hire handymen. You\u2019ll also need to market the platform and handyman apps to attract both customers and handymen.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, you\u2019ll need to ensure the platform runs smoothly in real-time, maintains trust, and provides value to both sides.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You don\u2019t need to do the physical work, your job is to manage the platform<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Potential for passive income once the platform is up and running<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>This type of business is often scalable. You can expand to multiple cities or regions without additional effort<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Handyman app development can be costly if you&#8217;re building the platform entirely from scratch.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Need strong customer support<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who is this suitable for: <\/strong>It\u2019s perfect for entrepreneurs, tech-savvy founders, or someone who wants to stay out of the physical labor side of the business but still wants to capitalize on the demand for handyman services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"property-management-model\">Property Management Model<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This model focuses on offering ongoing repair and maintenance services to landlords, property managers, or real estate agencies. Instead of one-time homeowner jobs, you manage multiple rental units or buildings under service agreements. It\u2019s steady, recurring work with clients who need reliability more than variety.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Stable, long-term income through contracts<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Less time spent on marketing or daily customer acquisition<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Opportunity to scale with larger portfolios over time<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Can involve strict service-level agreements (SLAs)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Less flexibility in choosing jobs<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Might need to be available for urgent fixes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who is this suitable for: <\/strong>Handyman professionals who prefer working behind the scenes with business clients rather than homeowners. It\u2019s ideal if you want a steady income, consistent work, and are open to maintaining multiple properties under fixed agreements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following canvas provides a generic framework for a handyman business. It is designed to give you a high-level overview of the key components involved in running your venture. Depending on the specific business model you choose (e.g., solo, team-based, subscription, or platform-based), you can customize the blocks to better fit your unique needs and goals. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"504\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/demandium.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/handyman-business-canvas-504x1024.webp\" alt=\"Handyman Business\" class=\"wp-image-24344\" srcset=\"https:\/\/demandium.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/handyman-business-canvas-504x1024.webp 504w, https:\/\/demandium.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/handyman-business-canvas-148x300.webp 148w, https:\/\/demandium.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/handyman-business-canvas-768x1560.webp 768w, https:\/\/demandium.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/handyman-business-canvas-756x1536.webp 756w, https:\/\/demandium.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/handyman-business-canvas.webp 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"revenue-models-in-the-handyman-industry\">Revenue Models in the Handyman Industry<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The handyman industry has different ways to make money. These are called revenue models. Each model works best depending on the type of handyman business you run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s walk through the most common ways the handyman industry earns revenue:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hourly-rate-model\">Hourly Rate Model<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For this revenue model, you charge a set amount for every hour you work. If a job takes two hours, you charge for two hours. This includes the time you spend working, but often not travel time or buying materials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is simple and fair for both sides. Customers only pay for the time you\u2019re there, and you get paid for every minute of work. It is good for jobs where it&#8217;s hard to know how long they will take. Also good for small, quick fixes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"flat-fee-model\">Flat Fee Model<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With this model, you charge one fixed price for a whole job. You agree on the price before you even start the work. This price covers all the labor for that specific task.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, you might charge $200 to paint a room or $50 to install a light fixture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This model is great for jobs that are straightforward and predictable. It gives customers peace of mind because they know the cost upfront. Works great for common jobs where you know exactly how long they usually take.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subscription-model\">Subscription Model<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where customers pay you regularly, like every month or every year. In return, they get certain services or benefits. You can offer different plans with benefits like priority booking, discounts, or scheduled visits. You get consistent income, and clients get peace of mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-based-model\">Commission-Based Model<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you run a platform or franchise, you can earn money through commissions. For example, you take a percentage of each job booked through your app or website. You don&#8217;t do the work yourself. You earn money from the handymen who use your platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The popularity of this is increasing as not everybody wants to do the physical labour themselves, but knows the potential of this passive and massive income opportunity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is good for you if you want to be a platform owner or tech entrepreneur. It can make a lot of money if many people use your platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"project-based-model\">Project-Based Model<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of small tasks, you take on full renovation or improvement projects. These are bigger, longer, and higher-paying.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this, you scope the entire project, give a quote for the full job, and break down timelines and milestones. Payment can be phased (e.g., 30% upfront, 40% midway, 30% at completion).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"membership-model\">Membership Model<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to the subscription model, this one offers exclusive benefits to members. For example, members might get priority service, discounts, or free inspections.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can offer tiered membership levels (basic, premium, etc.). Customers choose what suits them and pay monthly or yearly. This is best for businesses looking to build customer loyalty and predictable recurring revenue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-from-referrals\">Commission from Referrals<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this model, you earn money by referring customers to other handymen or businesses. For example, if a job is too big or specialized for you, you can recommend another handyman or contractor. In return, you receive a commission or referral fee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You make an agreement with another business, like a licensed plumber or electrician. When you send them a customer, and that customer hires them, they pay you a small percentage of the job&#8217;s cost. This is often called a referral fee. It helps you build good relationships with other local businesses. It also ensures your customers get the help they need, even if it&#8217;s not from you directly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"material-mark-up\">Material Mark-Up<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You charge a small extra fee on materials you buy and use for the job. It covers your effort, sourcing time, and sometimes transport.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You purchase materials needed for a task and include a markup, usually a percentage, on the final invoice. Be transparent so clients know they\u2019re paying for convenience, not just parts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tips-for-choosing-the-right-business-model-for-your-handyman-service\">Tips for Choosing the Right Business Model for Your Handyman Service<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing the right handyman business model depends on your skills, goals, and how you want to run your business. Here\u2019s a checklist that can help you decide correctly:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are your skills?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Are you good at many different repairs? The <strong>Solo<\/strong> or <strong>Team-Based<\/strong> model might fit.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do you have a special skill, like electrical work or smart home setup? A <strong>Specialized<\/strong> model could be perfect.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are you better at organizing and managing than at doing repairs? The <strong>Platform-Based<\/strong> model might be for you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How much money do you have to start?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If you have little money, starting as a <strong>Solo Handyman<\/strong> is often cheapest.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A <strong>Franchise<\/strong> or building a <strong>Platform<\/strong> from scratch usually needs a lot more money upfront.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How much time do you want to work?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Do you want to work full-time, or just on weekends? The <strong>Solo<\/strong> model gives you the most control over your hours.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A <strong>Team-Based<\/strong> business means more work managing, but you can take on more jobs.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A <strong>Subscription<\/strong> model needs regular visits, so you need to plan your time well.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What do people in your area need?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Look around your town.

Avoid these common errors to save time and money:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Jumping in without a plan can lead to chaos. Write down your goals, costs, and how you\u2019ll find customers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Charging too little might seem attractive, but it can hurt your profits. Research what others charge and price fairly.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It&#8217;s tempting to take every job. But doing too many different things can make you less good at any of them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keep your business money separate from your personal money. This makes taxes and tracking easier.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What works in one area might not work in another. So, ignoring local demand can cost you your upfront costs.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"essential-steps-to-start-your-profitable-handyman-startup\">Essential Steps to Start Your Profitable Handyman Startup<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you&#8217;ve thought about the different handyman business models and how to avoid common mistakes.

If you hire employees, add workers\u2019 compensation insurance to protect them. Check local regulations for any additional insurance requirements based on your service location<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1754218182988\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">What is the best business model for a handyman service?<\/h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>The best model depends on your goals. If you want flexibility, a solo or project-based model works well. For steady income, subscription or platform-based models are better. For growth, a multi-team or franchise model makes sense.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1754218183896\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Should I start as a freelancer or build a company?<\/h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Start as a freelancer if you\u2019re just testing the market or want to keep costs low. Build a company if you plan to grow, hire people, or offer services in multiple areas.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1754218184916\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">What is a platform-based handyman model and how does it work?<\/h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>A platform-based handyman model means you create and run an app or website. This platform connects customers who need work done with local handymen. You don&#8217;t do the repairs yourself. Instead, you earn money by charging handymen listing fees to be on your app, or by taking a commission (a small cut) from each job they get through your platform. Think of apps like TaskRabbit or Handy.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Here\u2019s something most new handymen never think about: the business model.
