I found a house with a beautiful backyard, a family pool, and a classic interior.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I entered through the main gate, the <strong>first thing<\/strong> that came to mind was, <strong>\u2018\u2018<\/strong>The lawn needs to be mowed.\u2019\u2019 After entering the house, I thought, \u201cOh damn\u2026 the walls &amp; ceilings need a renovation ASAP!<strong>\u201d&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let me be honest with you.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the house might look a bit old-fashioned, it was worth every penny I was about to spend.

It\u2019s a dedicated place for all the service providers (vendors) to manage their services while ensuring top-notch customer service.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, you get to keep track of your provider&#8217;s services and activities as an admin.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Serviceman App<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re the on demand business owner, you\u2019re less likely to provide all the services yourself. That\u2019s when the servicemen or the handyman comes in. It\u2019s the person who directly provides the service to the customer by going to their home.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep track of the total services provided or total services assigned, find customers&#8217; locations quickly, and receive payment from customers after service, the servicemen need a mobile app of their own.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Customer App\/Website<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The entire on demand home service business is about providing helpful home-based services to the customers. To ensure customers can find suitable services, you must have a personalized app and\/or website.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a place where the customer can feel at home and choose their favorite service provider, schedule the service at a preferred time, and enjoy flexible payment options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Must-Have Features for A Home Service Business&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From essential to crucial, you must take care of all your customers&#8217; needs. To start a home service business platform, you need to make sure the solution you\u2019re choosing is future-proof and authentic.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"508\" src=\"https:\/\/demandium.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/all-must-have-features-of-a-on-demand-home-service-business-platform-1024x508.webp\" alt=\"Must-Have Features for A Home Service Business\u00a0\" class=\"wp-image-20315\" srcset=\"https:\/\/demandium.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/all-must-have-features-of-a-on-demand-home-service-business-platform-1024x508.webp 1024w, https:\/\/demandium.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/all-must-have-features-of-a-on-demand-home-service-business-platform-300x149.webp 300w, https:\/\/demandium.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/all-must-have-features-of-a-on-demand-home-service-business-platform-768x381.webp 768w, https:\/\/demandium.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/all-must-have-features-of-a-on-demand-home-service-business-platform.webp 1090w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">All <a href=\"https:\/\/demandium.app\/blog\/on-demand-service-app-features\/\">must-have features<\/a> of a home service business platform-&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Dedicated Panels &amp; Apps<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As described above, it is crucial to have dedicated web panels &amp; apps for individual users according to their journey.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This includes an admin panel, service provider panel &amp; app (if you want to start as a multi vendor on demand eCommerce platform), a serviceman app for users who\u2019ll directly serve customers, and a user app &amp; website for customers for booking services.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Zone-wise Business<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You might want to start small, but as your business grows, you will need this feature. I mean, who\u2019ll want to stay in a single zone\/location forever when you\u2019re thriving on your on demand business?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having multi-zone enabled helps you reach more customers in different locations and extend your service line country-wide. It\u2019s a good catch if you\u2019re planning long-term to become an on demand business giant in your locality. PLUS: You can also set up zone-wise services.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Booking Management<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As the owner or admin of your on demand business, you must manage all the service bookings and booking-related activities.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may include- verifying booking requests, seeing customized booking requests, editing services, changing payment status, printing invoices, viewing booking status, and the list goes on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Self Registration<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This feature is important for user convenience. Look, it\u2019s not always possible to manually register all service providers, servicemen, and customers all by yourself, right?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if the users register themselves while you take care of other important tasks? The self-registration feature also allows you (the admin or business owner) to get more users by automating the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Service Categories<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Every customer is unique. So is every service provider. Just like you can\u2019t expect a plumber to paint walls, it\u2019s not possible to estimate all customers might have a single problem at their home. The more variety of services you offer, the better.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Popular service categories can be shifting, plumbing, painting, renovation, gadget repair, etc. After setting up the service categories, you can offer service variations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Service Provider Management<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a multi vendor on demand service platform to get your business started, your platform must have a service provider management system. The service providers are your vendors\/sellers who are selling their services to customers using your on demand platform.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the owner\/admin, you should be able to add new providers, review new provider onboarding requests, manage provider payments &amp; withdrawals, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Campaigns and Promotions<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>What sort of service are you offering if you don\u2019t offer discounts &amp; coupons to your customers?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Running promotional campaigns is an undeniable part of modern marketing. Your on demand service business should have this feature as well.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Wallets and Loyalty Points<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a virtual wallet &amp; loyalty program encourages customers to use your platform more and more. The wallet feature in your on demand service platform will enable customers to add funds to their wallet from third-party payment gateways, pay for service via wallet, receive loyalty points and referral earnings to their wallets, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Request Customization&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you have all the services in the world, yet your customer doesn\u2019t want what you\u2019re offering. They might want to tweak your services a little bit or maybe want two or more services at once. What happens then?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a booking request customization feature on your platform, your customers will love your business. No matter what, they\u2019ll keep returning for the unique customization and personalization facility you\u2019re offering.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Reports and Analysis<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The on demand home service business eCommerce platform you\u2019re choosing must have various reporting and analytics systems for you to get an overview of how your business is performing. So you can make future decisions based on real data.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some reports include transaction reports, business reports, booking reports, provider reports, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">11. Bidding System<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The bidding system feature, where multiple providers can place their pricing offers upon a single customization request from a customer, is pretty interesting.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example- A customer requested a backyard renovation with some custom instructions. Provider A is offering $100 for the task to be done, while Providers B, C, and D are offering $110, $90, and $95, respectively. Now, it\u2019s the customers&#8217; turn to choose the right provider with the right pricing they can afford. This feature enables customers to get the best service at the best prices. So, the bidding system can be a plus to your on demand platform.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">12. Employee Management<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s impossible for a single person to handle all of these. So you\u2019re gonna need employees to do a certain amount of tasks. So, the admin panel must have an employee management system.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this feature, you can set up employee roles and manage &amp; monitor employees at your free will.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">13. Help and Support<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The main goal of a business is to help customers with a problem. With your on demand service business, you\u2019re offering the same. So why not get a little closer to your customers by offering them live chat and call support as well?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">14. Refer and Earn<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To promote your on demand business through your customers, you can offer a refer &amp; earn program. This feature is so powerful that your business growth will eventually expand without you manually doing complex promotional activities.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So make sure the on demand solution you choose consists of this incredible feature.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">15. Track Booking<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like you (the admin), your customers should be able to track their service booking status from the user website or mobile app. So that they can understand where the serviceman is coming from or how much time it may take to complete the service, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">16. Smart Search and Filtration&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure your customers find the right service quickly, you must ensure that the search &amp; filtration option is powerful enough in your system.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feature should provide smart recommendations so customers can easily find what they are looking for.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">17. Guest Checkout<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Guest checkout is very popular among conventional eCommerce platforms, where customers can purchase a product or service without signing up and sharing their personal information.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can implement the guest checkout feature into your on demand service business, this will be a plus for you and your customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">18. Multi-Language<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The home service platform you\u2019re building must come up with a multi-language feature. Users can change the language according to their preferences and enjoy a native feel while using your solution.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">19. Dashboard with Statistics<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Dashboard with statistics is a very basic yet extremely important feature of any <a href=\"https:\/\/demandium.app\/blog\/on-demand-ecommerce\/\">On Demand eCommerce<\/a> business now. Regardless of user variations, be it admin, vendor\/seller\/provider, deliveryman\/serviceman, or customer, everybody must have their own dashboard with their platform usage history.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">20. Payment and Withdrawal<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Your on demand platform must allow 3rd party payment gateway integration facility so that users can easily pay and withdraw their money when necessary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other Technical Features Your On Demand Business Must Have-<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>SEO &amp; Analytics<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Payment &amp; SMS Gateways Integration<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apps on Android &amp; iOS<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cross-Platform Compatibility<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Customization Availability<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Firebase Push Notifications&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Google Map API<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Recaptcha&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>OTP &amp; Login<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Earning Model of On Demand Home Service business<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, I\u2019ve prepared an illustration for you to understand the basic business flow of every on demand business (multi vendor). But, of course, this model varies from business to business.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this illustration is sufficient for understanding the structure of how the business really works. You can see how every user (customer, provider, serviceman) is interlinked and how the admin makes a profit online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1090\" height=\"2174\" src=\"https:\/\/demandium.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/earning-model-of-on-demand-home-service-business.webp\" alt=\"Demand Home Service Business Model\" class=\"wp-image-20324\" srcset=\"https:\/\/demandium.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/earning-model-of-on-demand-home-service-business.webp 1090w, https:\/\/demandium.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/earning-model-of-on-demand-home-service-business-150x300.webp 150w, https:\/\/demandium.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/earning-model-of-on-demand-home-service-business-513x1024.webp 513w, https:\/\/demandium.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/earning-model-of-on-demand-home-service-business-768x1532.webp 768w, https:\/\/demandium.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/earning-model-of-on-demand-home-service-business-770x1536.webp 770w, https:\/\/demandium.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/earning-model-of-on-demand-home-service-business-1027x2048.webp 1027w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1090px) 100vw, 1090px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><strong>Figure: On demand service business model<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">On Demand Home Service Business Model&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from all the business models we know of, the <a href=\"https:\/\/demandium.app\/blog\/on-demand-service-business-models\/\">on demand home service business model<\/a> fits in the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p><strong>B2C Model<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you serve directly to the customers as an on demand service provider (in cases of single vendor eCommerce business) is when it\u2019s a B2C model.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>B2B2C Model<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s the most popular model of all time.
