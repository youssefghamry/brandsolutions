These services can include anything from fixing leaky faucets to installing drywall or even assembling furniture. Handymen are usually skilled in a variety of trades and can offer clients a one-stop solution for all their repair and maintenance needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many handyman businesses are run part-time, which gives business owners the flexibility to manage other responsibilities while serving their customers. The wide range of services offered makes handyman businesses popular with homeowners who need reliable help with their home projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is Starting a Handyman Business Profitable?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, starting a handyman business can be quite profitable.

Here are 13 key steps to guide you in getting your business up and running successfully.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Choose the Service You Want to Provide<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all handymen offer the same services. Decide which types of services you\u2019ll offer based on your skill set. Common handyman services include plumbing, electrical work, carpentry, painting, and general repairs. Focusing on specific areas will allow you to build a reputation in a niche market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you decide on the services you want to offer, take some time to research other handyman businesses in your area. This will help you understand the local market and how much they charge. Knowing this information will allow you to position your business better and stand out from the competition.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Make a Business Plan&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A business plan is essential for outlining your business goals, target market, services, and financial projections. It\u2019s a roadmap for your business and will help you make informed decisions as you grow. Your plan should also include strategies for marketing, customer acquisition, and pricing your services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Secure Your Startup Costs<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to secure the startup costs for your handyman business. Depending on the services you offer, you&#8217;ll need money for tools, insurance, marketing, and other expenses.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by figuring out how much money you&#8217;ll need to get your business up and running. This will help you find ways to fund your business, like using personal savings, loans, or investors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to keep your startup costs low to avoid financial problems early on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make a budget that shows what you expect to spend and how much you expect to earn. This will help you manage your business finances and make sure you have enough money for the necessary expenses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On average, the cost to start a handyman business ranges from $49,000 to $160,000.&nbsp; But it depends on the size of the business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Choose a Company Name<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing a company name is an important step in starting your handyman business. Your name should reflect your services and be easy for customers to remember. A good name can help you stand out and look professional. When thinking of names, try to include words related to your handyman services, which can also help people find you online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you choose any name, remember this-&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Check Name Availability<\/strong>: Ensure the name isn\u2019t already taken by another business.<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Domain Availability<\/strong>: Verify if the website domain is available if you plan to create a site.<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Branding Importance<\/strong>: Choose a name that fits your business and resonates with your target customers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>After choosing a business name, the next step is to register your handyman business. You\u2019ll need to register your business name with the local government in your state. This usually means filling out some forms and paying a small fee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get the Required Licence<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To run your handyman business legally, you\u2019ll need to get the right licenses and permits. These can differ based on where you live and the types of services you offer. In many areas, you\u2019ll need a contractor\u2019s license, especially if you plan to do specialized work like plumbing or electrical repairs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re wondering how to become a licensed handyman, it&#8217;s essential to research the specific licensing requirements in your state to make sure you follow the proper steps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting the right licenses not only allows you to work legally but also makes customers feel more confident in hiring your company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Purchase Tools and Equipment&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The right tools and equipment are crucial for running a successful handyman business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make a list of the tools you\u2019ll need to get started, so you have everything required to handle the tasks you offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, investing in good-quality tools can help you work more efficiently and do a better job. Some basic tools like-<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Hammer<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Screwdrivers (Flathead and Phillips)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tape Measure<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cordless Drill<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pliers (Needle-nose and regular)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adjustable Wrench<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Utility Knife<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Level<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Handsaw<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stud Finder<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Allen Wrenches (Hex Keys)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ladder<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Work Gloves<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Flashlight or Headlamp<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Caulking Gun<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Power Sander<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shop Vacuum<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Socket Set<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Portable Tool Box<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As a new handyman, it\u2019s a good idea to start with the basic tools you need and gradually add more as your business grows.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Set Prices<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to find a balance between offering affordable rates for your customers while ensuring you make a good profit. Research what other handymen in your area are charging for similar services and adjust your prices accordingly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure you consider your costs, such as tools, insurance, and travel expenses, so you can set prices that cover these and leave room for profit.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By setting competitive and fair prices, you can attract customers and ensure your business is profitable in the long run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Secure Insurance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting insurance is an important step to protect your handyman business from possible problems. General liability insurance is a must because it covers any damages or injuries that might happen while you\u2019re working at a customer\u2019s property. Having insurance not only protects you but also shows customers that you are professional and trustworthy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you plan to hire workers, you should also look into getting workers\u2019 compensation insurance to protect your employees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good insurance coverage gives you peace of mind, so you can focus on doing great work without worrying about accidents or unexpected costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When looking for insurance, compare quotes from different companies to find the best deal. By investing in the right insurance, you make your business stronger and build trust with your clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ensure Technology and Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with having the right physical tools, it\u2019s important to invest in technology to run your handyman business smoothly. Using the right software can help you manage everything you want. A good software solution saves you time, keeps your business organized, and makes you look more professional to your customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also important to create a website for your handyman business. A website acts like your online shop where potential customers can learn about your services, read reviews, and contact you easily.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A simple, clean, and mobile-friendly website can help you attract more clients and grow your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When starting your handyman business, it\u2019s a good idea to choose a ready-made software solution because it\u2019s more affordable and saves time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For on-demand service businesses, one of the best ready-made options is <a href=\"https:\/\/demandium.app\/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/demandium.app\/\">Demandium<\/a>.
