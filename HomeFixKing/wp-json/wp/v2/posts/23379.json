Especially during peak times. As customers expect same day delivery or instant delivery, businesses face the challenge of ensuring timely and accurate deliveries while maintaining efficiency.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Various platforms make logistics easier.
