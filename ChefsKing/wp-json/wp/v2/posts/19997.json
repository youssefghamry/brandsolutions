To enable this business model, the admin needs to set up their business rule from the business settings section of the admin panel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"419\" src=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/stackfood-commission-based-business-model-1024x419.webp\" alt=\"Commission-Based Business Model\" class=\"wp-image-19999\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/stackfood-commission-based-business-model-1024x419.webp 1024w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/stackfood-commission-based-business-model-300x123.webp 300w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/stackfood-commission-based-business-model-768x314.webp 768w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/stackfood-commission-based-business-model.webp 1090w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Admin can also change the commission amount according to different restaurants and charge different rates. For this, they need to go to the restaurant\u2019s list and select a specific restaurant. After that, the admin needs to click on the \u2018Edit\u2019 icon and then go to the restaurant setting section.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"459\" src=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/stackfood-commission-based-business-model-dashboard-1024x459.webp\" alt=\"Business Rule Setting\" class=\"wp-image-20000\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/stackfood-commission-based-business-model-dashboard-1024x459.webp 1024w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/stackfood-commission-based-business-model-dashboard-300x135.webp 300w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/stackfood-commission-based-business-model-dashboard-768x345.webp 768w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/stackfood-commission-based-business-model-dashboard.webp 1090w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, they can change the restaurant\u2019s business model and add different commission rates. Please note that if the admin doesn\u2019t add any commission rate from here, the default commission rate will apply to that specific restaurant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The commission-based business model serves as a win-win for both parties. Why? Because restaurants gain full access to the <a href=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/blog\/best-multi-restaurant-management-systems\/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/blog\/best-multi-restaurant-management-systems\/\">multi restaurant food ordering<\/a> platform without limitation. That means they can use all the features and facilities without restrictions. They also get a seamless platform for order management, while the admin enjoys a steady revenue stream. It&#8217;s a partnership that fuels success on all fronts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Subscription-based Business Model for Restaurants<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the subscription-based business model, the admin receives a regular subscription payment from the restaurants in a fixed amount. The payment schedule can be weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, yearly, etc. &nbsp;For this, the admin needs to create various subscription packages and allow app and panel permissions according to the package prices for the restaurants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After successfully creating subscription packages, the admin can manually add restaurants to the packages by changing their business model (that aren\u2019t using the subscription packages). For this, admin needs to do the following-&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Log in to the StackFood Admin Panel.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Go to the restaurant list &amp; select a specific restaurant.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on the \u2018Edit\u2019 icon &amp; go to the restaurant setting.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on the settings tab &amp; change the restaurant business model from \u2018Commission\u2019 to \u2018Subscription.\u2019&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>After changing the business model, go to the \u2018Subscription\u2019 tab.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click \u2018Add Subscription Package,\u2019 then choose a plan for the restaurant.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>After choosing the subscription plan, the admin needs to select a payment method- manual payment or payment via the restaurant\u2019s wallet and change their subscription.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the \u2018Manual Payment\u2019 method is selected, the admin will collect the subscription payment offline\/manually. But, if \u2018Pay from Restaurant Wallet\u2019 is selected, then the subscription fee will be automatically deducted from the restaurant\u2019s wallet on StackFood and will be added to the admin\u2019s earnings.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"558\" src=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/stackfood-resturent-registration-application-1024x558.webp\" alt=\"Admin Panel Settings\" class=\"wp-image-20011\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/stackfood-resturent-registration-application-1024x558.webp 1024w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/stackfood-resturent-registration-application-300x163.webp 300w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/stackfood-resturent-registration-application-768x419.webp 768w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/stackfood-resturent-registration-application.webp 1090w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A user can do self-registration as a restaurant owner and choose their preferred business model that is available on the system (without admin\u2019s help). For this, a user needs to log in to the StackFood System. A user can join as a restaurant from the following-<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Admin Landing Page (Business Website)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Flutter User App<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Flutter Web App<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>React Web App<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Restaurant App<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>After providing accurate information, the restaurant owner will be taken to the next page, where they need to choose a business model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Choose the \u2018Subscription-based\u2019 business model.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select a subscription plan &amp; proceed to payment.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Choose a payment method &amp; make payment.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Set up the restaurant and start adding food items.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>No two restaurants are the same, and StackFood understands this. That\u2019s why admin has the feature to create attractive commission-wise &amp; subscription-based packages that fit all restaurants&#8217; unique needs. This helps restaurants to choose a suitable plan while ensuring a fixed profit stream for the admin parallelly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Subscription Order Model for customers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>StackFood introduces a unique subscription model for customers that adds an extra layer of convenience to the food ordering process. These orders are pre-scheduled meal deliveries that occur on a regular basis. Users can set up their preferences, such as the frequency of deliveries, specific meal choices, and delivery times.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means your customers can have their favorite burrito from that nearby Mexican restaurant delivered to their home every Tuesday at 6 p.m. without placing a new order each time.<br>Here&#8217;s how it works: if the admin enables this feature from the backend, restaurants can choose to enable or disable it as well. When both sides are opt-in, customers gain the power to subscribe to their favorite restaurant on a regular basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"167\" src=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/subscription-order-model-for-customers-1024x167.webp\" alt=\"Subscription Based Order\n\" class=\"wp-image-20003\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/subscription-order-model-for-customers-1024x167.webp 1024w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/subscription-order-model-for-customers-300x49.webp 300w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/subscription-order-model-for-customers-768x125.webp 768w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/subscription-order-model-for-customers.webp 1090w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Test Case<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018Hungry Puppets\u2019 is a restaurant registered in the StackFood admin panel. The admin has enabled the \u2018Order Subscription\u2019 feature from the restaurant\u2019s settings. The owner of \u2018Hungry Puppets\u2019 has also enabled this feature from the restaurant panel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"183\" src=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/4-2-order-subscription-model-resturent-setup-1024x183.webp\" alt=\"Order Subscription\" class=\"wp-image-20005\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/4-2-order-subscription-model-resturent-setup-1024x183.webp 1024w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/4-2-order-subscription-model-resturent-setup-300x54.webp 300w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/4-2-order-subscription-model-resturent-setup-768x137.webp 768w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/4-2-order-subscription-model-resturent-setup.webp 1090w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, the restaurant owner must define their operating schedule, which means they can define the restaurant\u2019s opening and closing hours on a day-to-day basis. After saving the changes, the feature is now perfectly enabled.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Now let\u2019s see how it works on the user web app:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>From the user web app, customers can choose the order type: regular or subscription order. After choosing the subscription order, the customer can select the subscription type (daily, weekly, or monthly), subscription date, and schedule a time when they want to receive the food.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an incredible feature for customers who want to ensure on-time meal delivery on a daily basis.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-base-2-background-color has-background\"><strong><em>Also Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/blog\/best-successful-food-delivery-business-ideas\/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/blog\/best-successful-food-delivery-business-ideas\/\">10 Successful Food Delivery Business Ideas to Consider<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Summary<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With StackFood&#8217;s innovative business models, the <a href=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/blog\/common-food-delivery-business-challenges\/\">online food delivery business<\/a> isn&#8217;t just about eating; it&#8217;s about choices and convenience.
