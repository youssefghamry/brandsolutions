The admin has the freedom to add, manage, and monitor multiple restaurants while earning commission from the restaurants onboard.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers use the customer app or website provided by the platform to explore a variety of restaurants and cuisines. The system allows customers to select their preferred dishes, customize their orders, and add them to the cart.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a customer places an order, the platform sends the details to the restaurant, where staff view and prepare the meal. Once ready, the restaurant updates the status, and the platform notifies them to prepare for delivery. The restaurant packages the food and ensures it\u2019s ready for pickup by the delivery personnel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the order is ready, the platform assigns a driver to pick it up. The driver receives order details, picks up the food from the restaurant, and uses GPS to deliver it to the customer. After delivery, the driver confirms completion on the platform, ensuring efficient and timely service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, the platform is integrated with multiple payment methods including credit\/debit cards, digital wallets, or cash on delivery through which customers can pay for their orders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"key-components-of-online-food-ordering-platforms\">Key Components of Online Food Ordering Platforms<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, the platform includes several interconnected panels and apps for all stakeholders like the Admin Panel, Customer App and Website, Restaurant Panel or App, and Deliveryman App. Let\u2019s explore these key components:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"admin-panel\">Admin Panel<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The admin in an online food delivery platform plays a pivotal role in managing and overseeing the platform&#8217;s operations.

StackFood works smoothly on Android and iOS devices. It offers a responsive and user-friendly interface. Regular updates keep the platform up-to-date. Active support is available to assist users. The code is clean and easy to maintain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>StackFood presents two distinct revenue models for businesses: commission-based and subscription-based. With the commission-based model, you earn a percentage from every order processed through your platform.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, the subscription-based model allows restaurants to pay a fixed recurring fee for their presence on your platform. StackFood allows you to boost your earnings by offering advertising opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform&#8217;s features ensure the smooth management of a multi-restaurant business. StackFood comes as a ready-to-launch platform, with essential pre-integrated functionalities. It saves time and effort.<br><br>StackFood offers two kinds of Order Confirmation Model. In the Restaurant-first Order Confirmation Model, when a customer places an order through the StackFood app, the restaurant begins preparing the food while the delivery driver waits to pick it up. However, issue arises when no delivery driver is available to pick up this order at that given moment, the Deliveryman-first Order Confirmation Model addresses this issue. Here, the delivery driver first accepts the order, and then the restaurant is notified to start preparing the meal. This ensures that no orders are overlooked and that customers receive their food on time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-16018d1d wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https:\/\/1.envato.market\/Y9Dmnm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Get StackFood From Codecanyon<\/strong><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Features<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Responsive design<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>User-friendly website<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Multilingual support<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Multi restaurant support<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Built-in POS System<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Payment gateway integration<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Live chat with the user<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Multi-currency supported<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Intuitive dashboard<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rating and reviews<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Push notifications<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Third-party APIs integrations<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Zone-wise business setup<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"food-tiger-food-delivery-multiple-restaurants\">FoodTiger &#8211; Food delivery &#8211; Multiple Restaurants&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>FoodTiger is a powerful PHP script built on Laravel 8, designed to help you launch your own food delivery service quickly and easily.
