They are no longer a luxury for your customers rather, they have become a necessary part of them. The food sector was transformed by the pandemic. <strong>Food delivery business revenue<\/strong> skyrocketed since 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The food <a href=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/blog\/common-food-delivery-business-challenges\/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/blog\/common-food-delivery-business-challenges\/\">delivery business<\/a> is growing exponentially. So many giant rivals are competing to stay ahead in the food delivery game. You can expand your restaurant business by connecting with the right food delivery platform that will fit your needs. Your restaurant can&#8217;t earn much revenue without a proper business model, marketing strategy, and online exposure. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here food delivery apps or software come into play. With these platforms, a restaurant\u2019s online presence is strengthened, which can make all the difference. Through these apps, you can reach new customers and stay ahead of the competition. Restaurants partner up with these delivery apps to increase their profitability while promoting a better customer experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After reading this blog, you will have a clear idea of how the food app delivery industry works, which are the most popular apps, how they earn revenue, and which one you should choose for your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a Food Delivery App?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Food delivery apps are third-party restaurant delivery services that connect customers with restaurants located in the same area. Through the app, restaurants display and promote their products so consumers can see, select, and order desired goods.&nbsp; Upon confirmation of a new order, the restaurant is sent a notification to prepare, package, and deliver the food to the destination address. Through the app, restaurants can track sales, manage inventory, supervise order management, food management, delivery management, and other business aspects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Food Delivery App Industry<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some major components come into play in the operation of the <a href=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/blog\/restaurant-food-delivery-software\/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/blog\/restaurant-food-delivery-software\/\">food delivery<\/a> app industry. The food delivery apps provide restaurants with a platform to showcase their versatile food options and diverse cuisines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app earns revenue through commission and subscription. Apps cut off a fixed percentage as commission from the restaurant&#8217;s profit margin which typically ranges from 15% to 30%. In addition, they earn through commissions from deliverymen. Apps can also make a profit from restaurants through subscriptions. Another way restaurants can earn is through promotional services offered to restaurants. If a restaurant wants to use promotional service (videos, banners) they will have to pay for it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the app customers browse restaurant menus, place orders, and make payments. Restaurants earn directly from each payment of individual orders. Through the apps, restaurants can reach a wider consumer in a short period increasing online orders compared to dine-in orders. Businesses can highlight their product and promote sales. They can also boost sales by offering coupons and other tempting deals or discounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The restaurant business took a huge hit during the pandemic as dining outside came to a sudden stop. The food industry had to take a serious step to keep their business going. People no longer had access to physical stores which turned them to the alternative option- online stores\/services. There was a huge demand for online food delivery. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A huge number of restaurants approached delivery platforms like DoorDash and Postmates to meet their customer&#8217;s needs. According to statistics COVID contributed to 70% of the food delivery industry growth. Since the pandemic, the restaurant sector has transformed through the food delivery business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the statistics reported by Statista, the online food delivery industry is estimated to reach $1.20tn in 2024. Revenue in the Grocery Delivery Market is expected to grow 20.0% in 2025. In the food industry, the most noteworthy operators are DoorDash (45%) and Uber Eats (22%).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><strong><em>Also Read: <\/em><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/blog\/build-a-food-delivery-app-like-uber-eats\/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/blog\/build-a-food-delivery-app-like-uber-eats\/\"><em><strong>How to Build a Food Delivery App Like Uber Eats?<\/strong><\/em><\/a><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Revenue Generated by Food Delivery in Different Countries<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to other countries China is in the leading position in the food delivery business.

There are thousands of restaurant businesses offering diverse food options, and fast delivery which makes the competition more fierce. Keeping up with this marketing competition is a complex task.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Online food deliveries require proper food packaging that can preserve food until drop off, which comes with additional costs. Retaining customers among so much competition is one of the most complex and important tasks a restaurant has to accomplish which will define its success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Words&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The food industry has gone through a major transformation since the inception of food delivery apps.
