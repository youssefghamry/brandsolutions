Customers can browse menus, place orders, and pay online. The restaurant prepares the food, and a delivery driver brings it to the customer&#8217;s door. It&#8217;s convenient for customers and offers restaurants a new way to reach more people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-start-a-food-delivery-business-in-india\">Why Start a Food Delivery Business in India?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s talk about numbers first. The online food delivery market in India is expected to reach US$102.43 billion by 2030. That&#8217;s a massive pie, and there&#8217;s plenty of room for new players to grab a slice.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it\u2019s time to have a look at the factors that make it hard to sit back on the couch instead of starting a promising food delivery business in India.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"market-potential\">Market Potential<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>India&#8217;s diverse population and growing internet penetration create a massive potential customer base for online food delivery businesses. Also, families with working parents and youth having access to the Internet have contributed to the demand for food delivery apps in India. Urbanization is on the rise, and people are busier than ever. These factors create a huge demand for convenient food delivery services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"consumer-behavior\">Consumer Behavior<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Indians love their food, and they love convenience even more. Studies show that customers prefer ordering food online rather than cooking at home, especially during dinner time. Also, it was visible that people are more inclined towards fast food and north Indian cuisine. These consumers are tech-savvy brand-conscious and value convenience above all else. This presents a golden opportunity for food delivery apps in India to deliver a seamless and user-friendly online food ordering experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"success-stories\">Success Stories<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many startups in India have become very popular by entering this market. Companies like Swiggy and Zomato have changed how Indians order food. Their success shows that with the right plan and execution, new businesses can thrive in this industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"food-delivery-business-revenue-model\">Food Delivery Business Revenue Model<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let\u2019s talk about the most important part of any business &#8211; revenue. There are a couple of main ways you can earn as an admin or business owner:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Commission on Orders:<\/strong> In this system, as a food delivery business owner you will be able to charge restaurants a commission on each order placed through the app or website.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Delivery Fees:<\/strong> Customers might also be charged a delivery fee on top of their order total. This fee can be fixed or vary based on factors like distance and order size.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advertising:<\/strong> Restaurants can pay to be featured prominently on the app. This is a great way to earn extra revenue as a business owner.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Subscriptions:<\/strong> Subscriptions offer a steady income for businesses. This model ensures predictable revenue and helps in planning expenses. It also builds customer loyalty, as subscribers are more likely to stick with your service.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"921\" src=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/food-delivery-business-revenue-model.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21296\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/food-delivery-business-revenue-model.webp 900w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/food-delivery-business-revenue-model-293x300.webp 293w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/food-delivery-business-revenue-model-768x786.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Different Revenue Models of Food Delivery Business<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-do-you-need-to-know-about-starting-an-online-food-delivery-business\">What Do You Need to Know About Starting an Online Food Delivery Business?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting an online food delivery business in India can be rewarding, but there are a few key things to keep in mind before you jump in:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Know your market:<\/strong> Understand the demand in your area and who your customers are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Choose the right business model: <\/strong>Decide if you\u2019ll partner with restaurants or run your own kitchen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Build a strong platform:<\/strong> Your app or website should be easy to use for customers, restaurants, and delivery staff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Plan your budget:<\/strong> Consider costs like technology, marketing, and delivery operations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Follow regulations:<\/strong> Stay updated on local food safety and business laws.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Focus on quality:<\/strong> Fast delivery is great, but good food and service keep customers coming back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Prepare to adapt:<\/strong> The food delivery market changes fast.

But for that, you need careful planning and put your best foot forward to make it a success.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how to start food delivery business &#8211;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-market-research-and-planning\">1. Market Research and Planning&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It all starts with understanding your target audience. Ask yourself questions like &#8211;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Who are you trying to serve?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What are their needs and preferences?&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have written those down, try to research top <a href=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/blog\/best-successful-food-delivery-business-ideas\/\">food delivery business ideas<\/a>. It will clear your idea more about the industry and expand your potential. Also, make sure to do competitor research. This way, you will be able to understand any existing market gap and work on resolving that.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-choose-a-business-model\">2. Choose a Business Model&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First, decide whether you want to partner with existing restaurants (multi vendor food delivery system) or set up your own kitchen (single vendor food delivery system). Partnering with restaurants can be quicker and less costly. On the other hand, creating your own kitchen gives you complete control over the food quality and menu.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, think about how your delivery service will work. Will you go for on-demand deliveries where customers order and get their food right away? Or will you offer scheduled deliveries? Each choice affects how you operate and market your service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you choose better, here\u2019s a quick look at the common food delivery business models that are already working in India:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Order-Only Model: <\/strong>You build a platform that connects users to restaurants. The restaurants handle food and delivery, your job is to run the app and manage orders. <br><br><strong>Ideal for:<\/strong> Low startup budget, multi-vendor platform<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.<\/strong> <strong>Order &amp; Delivery Model:<\/strong> You manage both the ordering system and the delivery. Restaurants cook the food; your team delivers it.<br><br><strong>Ideal for:<\/strong> Moderate budget, more control over delivery quality<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3.<\/strong> <strong>Cloud Kitchen Model:<\/strong> You run your own kitchen without a dining space. All orders come through your app or third-party platforms.<br><br><strong>Ideal for:<\/strong> Single-vendor setups, full control over food<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Hybrid Model:<\/strong> You allow both restaurant partners and your own kitchen to coexist on your platform. Some orders are delivered by partners, others by your own delivery team.<br><br><strong>Ideal for:<\/strong> Growing platforms wanting more flexibility<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in learning more about the different types of food delivery models and their pros and cons, check out our detailed guide on <a href=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/blog\/food-delivery-business-model\/\">food delivery business models<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-create-a-business-plan\">3. Create a Business Plan<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For this step, start by outlining our business goals, such as your target market and what you hope to achieve in the first year. Then define the strategies you\u2019re going to use to achieve these goals.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also have to have a section called \u2018Financial Projection\u2019. Here you will estimate startup cost for food delivery business like expected revenue, and profits.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, plan your budget carefully. Calculate startup costs, such as technology, marketing, kitchen setup ( if a single vendor model is chosen), and initial staff hires. Don&#8217;t forget ongoing expenses like delivery logistics, salaries, utilities, and marketing. This budgeting helps you understand how much capital you need and manage your finances effectively.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-register-your-business\">4. Register Your Business<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a crucial part. First decide on your business structure, whether it\u2019s a Private Limited Company, Public Limited Company, One Person Company, LLP, Partnership Firm, or Sole Proprietorship. If your business exceeds the GST threshold limit, you will have to register for this license.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, apply for a Health Trade License to ensure your food is prepared hygienically and safely. The FSSAI License is a must for every food establishment across India. Make sure to get a Signage License, Trademark Registration, and Shop and Establishment Certification to promote and protect your business. It usually takes around 25-30 working days to complete the process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-build-your-online-platform\">5. Build Your Online Platform<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Building your online platform is a crucial step in starting your food delivery business. This platform will manage your operations efficiently. You can choose from these two popular options: building from scratch or using a ready-made solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Custom development demands a substantial commitment of time and money. The end result of software or performance is highly influenced by the skill of your developer or development team and can either produce a high-quality platform or a buggy one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, a ready-made software solution allows you to launch your business with less investment and time. These solutions are designed with market and business needs in mind. So you can save a lot of time in the market research and analysis phase. Before release, the software undergoes thorough testing to ensure it&#8217;s bug-free and ready for immediate use. This approach minimizes the risk of encountering issues. It allows for a smooth and efficient start to your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if time, cost, and tech are concerns, and you want to know how to start a business in India with low investment, <a href=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/\">StackFood<\/a> can help.

Partner with Restaurants<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you plan to do a multi vendor online food delivery service in India, then this step is required, otherwise, skip reading to the next one.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can start by approaching local eateries and showing them the benefits of joining a platform like yours. Have a partnership agreement signed before onboarding to be transparent and avoid potential business risks. Make sure to highlight the mutual benefits and the ease of joining your platform. This partnership model helps in scaling your business quickly and effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7-set-up-delivery-logistics\">7. Set Up Delivery Logistics<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you plan to build a single vendor food delivery business then it\u2019s a must. Also, many multivendor service providers deliver through their own deliveryman or sign up with a third-party delivery service provider rather than depending on the partner restaurants on the platform.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your goal is to ensure food reaches customers quickly and efficiently. You can achieve this with timely delivery. For this, you can regularly train your team on best practices.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8-marketing-and-promotion\">8. Marketing and Promotion<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Marketing and promotion are essential to attract customers to your food delivery business. Think about how top food delivery companies in India like Zomato or similar services have established their brand on the market. Even if someone sees their logo anywhere they immediately know what brand it is.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be on that level in the market, start by taking advantage of social media platforms. As Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube are the most used platforms in India, try to target your audience from here. Create engaging posts and ads to showcase your offerings. Online ads can target specific demographics and ensure your promotions reach the right people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also offer introductory discounts and other promotional offers like referral points, loyalty points, free delivery, etc. Consistent and strategic marketing efforts will help build your customer base and increase brand visibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9-launch-and-monitor\">9. Launch and Monitor&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it\u2019s finally time to launch and start doing your dream business. In this step, also take advantage of social media and announce the launch.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your platform is live, keep a close eye on its performance. Track key metrics like order volume, delivery times, and customer satisfaction. Encourage customers to leave feedback on their experience. This will help new customers find authenticity in your business. Also, these feedbacks help you identify any areas of improvement and level up your business.

The cost can change a lot based on your choice, as you can either build a platform from scratch or pick a ready-made solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, let\u2019s have a look at the cost components that you will have to consider:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Platform development<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Marketing and promotions<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Operational Costs<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Licensing and Compliance<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Technology and Tools<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a fully customized platform can cost anywhere between \u20b95,00,000 to \u20b920,00,000+, depending on the complexity and features. On the other hand, if you go for a readymade solution, for example, StackFood, the cost can start from $69 and can be $226, depending on the package you choose for a regular license.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>StackFood Pricing Overview:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>License Type<\/strong><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>Starter<\/strong><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>Combo<\/strong><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>Super Combo<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>Regular License<\/strong><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">$69<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">$127<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">$226<\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>Extended License<\/strong><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">$399<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">$597<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">$996<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Kitchen setup adds another \u20b92.8\u202fL\u20136.6\u202fL (approximate), depending on the cloud\/kitchen size.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For licensing and registration, it may take \u20b9100 to \u20b97,500 annually, excluding GST.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart Takeaways:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Know your budget before choosing custom or off-the-shelf.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Factor in kitchen costs, they\u2019re a big chunk, often more than tech.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Go step-by-step.

Here are a few common ones you\u2019ll want to steer clear of while thinking about how to start a food delivery service:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skipping market research:<\/strong> Don\u2019t just assume what people want. Study your local area, understand your competitors, and know what your target customers expect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Choosing the wrong business model:<\/strong> Whether it\u2019s single vendor or multi-vendor, your model should match your resources, goals, and long-term vision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Underestimating tech requirements:<\/strong> A glitchy app or missing features can kill your customer\u2019s trust. Whether you build or buy, make sure your platform is solid and tested.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>No plan for delivery logistics:<\/strong> Without a reliable delivery system, even the best food won\u2019t make it to the customer. Plan your delivery routes, timings, and personnel clearly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Weak branding and online presence:<\/strong> If people can\u2019t find or recognize your brand, they won\u2019t order. Focus on creating a strong name, clean visuals, and a working website\/app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ignoring customer feedback:<\/strong> Early feedback is gold. Use it to fix issues, add new features, and show customers you actually care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Trying to do everything yourself:<\/strong> It\u2019s tempting to wear all the hats, but that usually leads to burnout. Delegate where you can, especially for tech, support, and marketing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-future-of-online-food-delivery-in-india\">The Future of Online Food Delivery in India<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The future of online food delivery in India is changing fast because of new technology, customer habits, and better internet access. <strong>AI and automation<\/strong> will play a big role as they help predict what customers want and make deliveries faster and more accurately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cloud kitchens<\/strong>, which are delivery-only setups without dine-in spaces, are becoming popular because they save money and focus only on online orders. More restaurants will likely use this model to serve delivery customers, especially in cities.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sustainability <\/strong>is also becoming important, so platforms will start using eco-friendly packaging and electric vehicles. Some may even reward customers for choosing green options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Businesses will also focus on providing a seamless experience across apps, websites, and social media to build trust. <strong>Health-focused meals <\/strong>will grow in demand as a food delivery option in India, so platforms will work with fitness-friendly restaurants and highlight nutritious options. <strong>Rural areas<\/strong> are another opportunity, and platforms will partner with local eateries to reach these markets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group blog-tips\"><div
