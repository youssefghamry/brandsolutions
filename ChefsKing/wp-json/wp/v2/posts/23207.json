It can be busy parents, office workers, students, late-night snackers, etc. Each group has different habits, so your messaging should match their needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, make it easy to find and trust you. This means:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A clear online presence (Google, Maps, website).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Strong social media profiles with good photos and reviews.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Simple, fast ordering with no sign-up hurdles.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, focus on offers that make people act. Think first-time discounts, free delivery, or meal combos that feel like a deal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some additional ways:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Partner with local influencers for shoutouts.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Run geo-targeted ads so your offer hits the right people.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use a loyalty program to bring customers back.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So you see, it all starts with who you\u2019re marketing to. You need to find out first who your customers are. Let\u2019s have a brief overview of that concept:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who Are Your Customers and What Do They Want?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everyone likes the same food or service. Some people care about fast delivery. Others want healthy meals or budget-friendly options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To figure this out:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Ask for feedback after orders.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Study reviews and ratings.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Watch which menu items sell the most.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if most of your customers are students, focus on affordable meals and late-night delivery.

It includes everything from social media posts to email campaigns, loyalty programs, and even partnerships with food apps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of it as your roadmap to success. Without a strategy, your efforts might feel scattered, and you could miss opportunities to grow your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the Benefits of Having a Marketing Strategy for an Online Food Delivery Business?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, why should you bother creating a marketing strategy? Let\u2019s break it down below &#8211;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Attract More Customers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about it: how will people find your business if you don\u2019t promote it?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good strategy helps you reach new customers who haven\u2019t heard of you yet. For example, running ads on Facebook or Instagram can introduce your food to thousands of potential buyers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Build a Loyal Customer Base<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When your message is clear and your service is consistent, people come back. A good strategy helps you create repeat business.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Helps You Stand Out<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s be honest &#8211; there are tons of food delivery options out there. A sharp digital marketing plan helps you show why you\u2019re different. Maybe it\u2019s your faster delivery, better pricing, or unique dishes. The right message helps you own that difference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Saves Time and Money<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Without a plan, you might waste money on things that don\u2019t work, like random ads or promotions that flop. A strategy helps you focus on what actually brings results.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can save time and money by focusing your efforts on what works, and you can be sure that every dollar you spend improves your overall objectives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Data-Driven Decisions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll know what works and what doesn&#8217;t, so you can spend money on marketing that actually brings results. This realization helps you allocate your money sensibly, focusing on channels and strategies that produce actual results.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investing in marketing strategies that increase involvement, sales, and finally, business growth will help you avoid wasting resources on guesswork. Less wasted money and more relevant actions that appeal to your audience follow from this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">12 Powerful Marketing Strategies for a Food Delivery Business<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we understand the foundation, let&#8217;s dive into the real work. These proven strategies will transform your food delivery business from invisible to irresistible.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"884\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/marketing-strategies-for-food-delivery-business-884x1024.webp\" alt=\"Marketing Strategies for Food Delivery Business\u00a0\" class=\"wp-image-23215\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/marketing-strategies-for-food-delivery-business-884x1024.webp 884w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/marketing-strategies-for-food-delivery-business-259x300.webp 259w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/marketing-strategies-for-food-delivery-business-768x890.webp 768w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/marketing-strategies-for-food-delivery-business.webp 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 884px) 100vw, 884px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rank Higher with Local SEO and Google Business Profile<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before running ads or jumping onto every social platform, food delivery businesses should start with something more foundational <strong>local visibility.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this step, first think from your customers\u2019 perspectives while searching. Let me show you a few examples:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cLate-night pizza delivery near me\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBest burgers in New York\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHalal food delivery Bologna \u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are intent-driven searches, and if your restaurant or delivery brand isn\u2019t showing up here, you\u2019re missing customers who are actively looking to order. It\u2019s one of the greatest local restaurant marketing tactics.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you should start by claiming and optimizing your <strong>Google Business Profile<\/strong>. It\u2019s free, and it\u2019s often the first thing people see when they search for food delivery in your area. Once your profile is live and optimized, you can go into more advanced settings of Local SEO.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For example:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maneki Ramen is a Japanese restaurant in Worcester, UK used a local SEO strategy to target keywords like \u201cJapanese food near me.\u201d They improved their Google Business Profile and website to help people find them. As a result, they had over 3,000 profile interactions in one month. This was a 40.4% increase from the previous year. They also saw a big rise in calls and website visits, which led to more bookings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Best Practices Checklist:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2705 Google Business Profile fully updated (every 30\u201360 days)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2705 Delivery keywords added to website pages and metadata<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2705 Menu structured with SEO-friendly URLs<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2705 Use schema markup for location and delivery info<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2705 Encourage keyword-rich Google reviews from regulars<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Extra Tip:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use tools like Moz Local or BrightLocal to check your listings in directories. These tools help find problems, like missing addresses, old phone numbers, or unclaimed citations that can hurt your rankings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Run Targeted Ads on Facebook and Instagram<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media ads can be a goldmine for food delivery businesses if used correctly. While many throw money at random ads in the name of social media strategy for food delivery, the most successful brands use highly targeted campaigns designed to speak directly to their ideal customer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by identifying your customer segment. Ask these questions to yourself-&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you targeting young professionals in the city?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Health-conscious students?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Late-night snackers?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, you should &#8211;<br><br>\u2705Set up your ad manager account ( if you do not have one already )&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2705Create a new campaign<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2705Define Audience<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2705Set budget and schedule&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2705Choose Ad placement<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2705Create Ad&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2705Monitor and Analysis&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let\u2019s have a look at a real-world scenario:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Foodpanda wanted to improve its customer acquisition efficiency, it ran A\/B tests on Facebook using Meta Advantage+ catalogue ads. This approach resulted in a 9% lower cost per first order, proving the effectiveness of data-driven ad optimization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Extra Tip:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always A\/B test different versions, and track metrics like click-through rates and return on ad spend (ROAS). That\u2019s how you turn ad dollars into repeat customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Partner with Local Restaurants<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you operate a multi-restaurant food delivery platform, forming strategic partnerships with local eateries is more than a business model; it\u2019s a marketing opportunity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s how it works:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Promote your restaurant partners through co-branded campaigns<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Highlight them in email newsletters or social media shoutouts<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offer joint deals that benefit both brands (e.g., \u201cOrder from SushiKing and get 10% off your next pizza from Bella Italia\u201d)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This type of cross-promotion helps both sides grow. For the platform, it builds credibility by aligning with popular or trusted local names. For the restaurant, it brings new orders without needing extra tech or delivery resources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Send Push Notifications and SMS at the Right Time<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Push notifications and SMS can be a powerful tool. But you need to be careful and precise. Used poorly, they become annoying. But used strategically, they drive immediate action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The key is timing and relevance.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t blast users with daily messages. Instead, segment your audience. Here\u2019s an example of what you can do:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Send lunch reminders around 11:30 AM to office workers<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offer late-night deals to students and night owls<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Send messages about personalized favorites or past orders<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>Extra Tip:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use urgency. Messages like \u201cOnly 1 hour left!\u201d create action. You can also include a clear CTA with a direct link to the ordering page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Launch a Referral Program<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Word-of-mouth is still one of the most powerful drivers of growth. Referral programs play a crucial role in this case.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for a referral program to work, it must offer real value on both ends. People trust recommendations from friends more than ads. A good referral system turns customers into marketers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example setup:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Referrer Gets<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Friend Gets<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20% off next order<\/td><td>Free delivery on first order<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Add a \u201cRefer a friend\u201d button right inside your app. Let users copy a referral code, send it via WhatsApp, or post on social.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Extra Tip:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make it visible. Promote referral programs on your homepage, order confirmation pages, and push messages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Build Loyalty Programs for Delivery Services<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Customer acquisition is expensive. Loyalty programs are a game-changer for keeping customers coming back.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great example is Uber Eats\u2019 Eats Pass. For a small monthly fee, subscribers get free delivery and discounts on eligible orders, along with access to exclusive promotions. It\u2019s simple, rewarding, and keeps people hooked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Best Practices:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2705Offer points or perks for every purchase to encourage repeat business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2705 Provide rewards like free delivery, discounts, or exclusive deals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2705Celebrate milestones with messages like, \u201cCongrats on your 10th order!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Extra Tip:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make your loyalty program feel personal by surprising customers with bonuses during holidays or on their birthdays. It\u2019s these little touches that make people feel valued.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Work With Food Bloggers and Local Influencers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Influencers already have loyal followers who trust their recommendations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why not tap into that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collaborating with local food influencers and bloggers can put your brand in front of thousands of hungry followers in a matter of hours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here\u2019s the trick: don\u2019t chase the biggest name while going for influencer marketing. Go local. Find micro-influencers (3k\u201330k followers) in your city who:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Actively post about takeout, delivery, or restaurant experiences<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have strong engagement (likes, comments, shares, and not just followers)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have an audience that overlaps with your target customers<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Take DoorDash\u2019s Miami campaign, for example. They teamed up with local influencers to promote their service and share exclusive promo codes. The result? DoorDash\u2019s Miami campaign brought in more than 8,500 new customers in just 20 days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Best Practices:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2705 Send a free meal in exchange for a reel, TikTok, or story<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2705 Provide a promo code that they can offer to their followers<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2705 Track each creator\u2019s code to measure ROI<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Extra Tip:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collaborate with micro-influencers. They often charge less but have highly engaged audiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get Listed on Popular Review and Delivery Aggregator Sites<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A big chunk of customers don\u2019t search for your food delivery app or brand directly. They discover you through platforms they already trust.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why listings and reviews on platforms like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Google Business<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Yelp<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Zomato<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>TripAdvisor<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Trustpilot<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>App stores (for delivery apps)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;can make or break first impressions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure you claim and optimize your profile:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Add high-quality food photos<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keep menus, delivery hours, and location details updated<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reply to reviews (good or bad) with professionalism<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:<\/strong> Uber Eats took the approach to building trust by claiming their profile on Trustpilot, a platform where real users can share their honest opinions. To encourage feedback, they sent review invitations outside of Trustpilot\u2019s systems, which are automatically labeled as \u201cinvited.\u201d This strategy not only increased the number of reviews but also showcased authentic customer experiences (both good and bad).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"511\" src=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/trustpilot.webp\" alt=\"Trustpilot Review Uber Eats\" class=\"wp-image-23217\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/trustpilot.webp 900w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/trustpilot-300x170.webp 300w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/trustpilot-768x436.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Best Practices:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2705 Encourage happy customers to leave a review with post-order follow-ups<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2705 Use reviews as marketing assets.

The key is to create content that appeals to both restaurants and customers while keeping the platform lively and engaging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What to post:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Rider stories or behind-the-scenes delivery moments<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Creator collabs with food bloggers, ordering from your app<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Funny, relatable memes about late-night cravings or indecisive eaters<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Top-ordered dishes in your city (and what it says about the people there)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reels of new restaurant launches or limited-time menus<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Polls that get users involved (\u201cWhich city orders more burgers?\u201d)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uber Eats nailed this with their \u201cGet almost, almost anything\u201d campaign. They brought in a globally recognized actor and used humor-driven storytelling to show just how far their delivery range goes, without overpromising.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of them was Tom Felton, known for playing a sneaky wizard. In the ad, he tries to order a magic wand but ends up causing chaos by accidentally making his neighbor disappear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The campaign shows how Uber Eats isn\u2019t just for food\u2014you can order groceries, and more.

Running a promotion is easy for many food business owners, but it\u2019s the strategy that makes the difference.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Best Practices:<\/strong><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2705Create urgency with time-bound offers like \u201cOrder in the next hour and save 20%.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2705Bundle deals, such as \u201cBuy one, get one free\u201d or \u201cAdd a drink for $1 with any meal.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2705Tailor promotions to specific audiences\u2014students, families, or late-night snackers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, discounts should drive volume and retention, not just eat into margins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Optimize App Store Listing for Your Food Delivery App<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your food delivery app isn\u2019t optimized for app stores, you&#8217;re leaving thousands of potential users behind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>App Store Optimization (ASO) is like SEO (Search Engine Optimization), but for apps. It helps you rank higher in search results when users look for on-demand food delivery services near them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your ASO checklist:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Keyword-rich app name &amp; subtitle (e.g., \u201cXYZ \u2013 Fast Food Delivery in Jeddah\u201d)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Compelling screenshots with benefit-driven captions<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>High-converting app description&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Regular review responses to show engagement<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Strong review &amp; rating acquisition strategy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Better ASO means more installs or customer acquisition for food apps without spending a dime on ads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, even the popular food delivery apps like Uber Eats, Doordash use ASO strategies to keep themselves relevant and competitive in this industry.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Build a High-Performance Website That Converts<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if your business is mobile-first, don\u2019t underestimate the power of a high-converting website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your site is often the first stop for new customers (especially from Google). If it\u2019s clear, engaging, and up-to-date, you\u2019re already winning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What your website should do:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Clearly explain how your delivery service works<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Show real-time delivery zones or coverage<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Feature top restaurants or trending meals<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Include prominent app download CTAs<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Load in under 3 seconds on mobile<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A live chat feature for instant customer support.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mistakes to Avoid When Marketing a Food Delivery Business<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you\u2019ve listed down the strategies. Now it\u2019s time to take note of the mistakes that many food delivery businesses have made and what you must avoid if you want results without wasting time and money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Sending too many messages or notifications<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Not checking what\u2019s working through data<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Trying to target everyone at once<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Changing your brand look and voice too often<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Running ads without testing different versions<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ignoring repeat customers and focusing only on new ones<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Copying competitors without a clear plan<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Having a slow or hard-to-use website or app<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offering discounts all the time with no profit plan<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Not replying to customer reviews or messages<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Investing or partnering with a wrong marketing agency&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Can StackFood Help Market Your Food Delivery Business?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/\">StackFood<\/a> is an all-in-one food delivery solution that comes with complete and tested source code.
