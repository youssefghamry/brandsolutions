These businesses typically have in-house delivery fleets and a high level of control over their operations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Revenue Model<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A solid revenue model is vital for food delivery startups to sustain operations, scale, and remain competitive in the market. The following are the primary revenue models in this industry:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Commission-Based Model:<\/strong> Most food delivery startups use a commission-based revenue model, where they earn a percentage of each transaction processed through the platform. This percentage varies, but it typically ranges from 15% to 30% of the total order value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uber Eats uses a commission-based model. They charge restaurants a commission fee that usually ranges between 15% and 30% of the order value, depending on the restaurant&#8217;s agreement with Uber Eats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Subscription-Based Model:<\/strong> In the meal delivery subscription-based model, restaurants pay a recurring fee to be listed on the platform. This can be a monthly, quarterly, or annual fee that gives restaurants access to the platform&#8217;s customer base, marketing tools, and analytics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Delivery Fee:<\/strong> In addition to commissions, delivery fees are commonly charged directly to customers to cover the cost of transporting the food from the restaurant to the customer. These fees can vary depending on factors such as distance, time, surge pricing, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Start a Food Delivery Startup Business?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to start a food delivery startup business, you need to go through some steps to start and successfully run the business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"879\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/steps-to-start-a-food-delivery-business-879x1024.webp\" alt=\"Steps to Start a Food Delivery Business\" class=\"wp-image-22966\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/steps-to-start-a-food-delivery-business-879x1024.webp 879w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/steps-to-start-a-food-delivery-business-258x300.webp 258w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/steps-to-start-a-food-delivery-business-768x894.webp 768w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/steps-to-start-a-food-delivery-business.webp 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 879px) 100vw, 879px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Research the Market<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you start a food delivery service, it\u2019s important to understand what people in your target area want.

Are your customers satisfied with the food quality?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listen to feedback and make adjustments.
