Deliveroo\u2019s success isn\u2019t just about delivering food\u2014it\u2019s a great example of how to grow fast, reach new markets, and run operations efficiently.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding how Deliveroo works can help business owners and entrepreneurs learn valuable lessons about starting a food delivery business.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re thinking about starting a food delivery service like Deliveroo or just want to know more about the <strong>Deliveroo Business Model<\/strong>, this blog will help you a lot!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Deliveroo and How Did It Start?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Deliveroo is an online food delivery platform that started in London in 2013. Will Shu and Greg Orlowski founded the company to improve restaurant food delivery.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They saw a gap in the market for a service that could bring food quickly and efficiently from restaurants to customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"569\" src=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/deliveroo.webp\" alt=\"Deliveroo\" class=\"wp-image-23104\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/deliveroo.webp 900w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/deliveroo-300x190.webp 300w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/deliveroo-768x486.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, Deliveroo focused on working with restaurants that didn\u2019t have their own delivery service. Using a team of riders, it provided a fast and reliable way for people to get their favorite meals at home.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, Deliveroo expanded to different countries and introduced new services like Deliveroo Editions, which are delivery-only kitchens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Core Components of Deliveroo&#8217;s Business Model<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Deliveroo\u2019s business model is built on several core components that work smoothly to deliver an efficient and reliable food delivery service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"858\" src=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/deliveroo-business-model.webp\" alt=\"Deliveroo Business Model\" class=\"wp-image-23119\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/deliveroo-business-model.webp 900w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/deliveroo-business-model-300x286.webp 300w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/deliveroo-business-model-768x732.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Does Deliveroo Make Money?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Deliveroo is a <a href=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/blog\/online-food-ordering-platforms\/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/blog\/online-food-ordering-platforms\/\">food delivery platform<\/a> that connects customers with restaurants and drivers. It makes money in different ways, including commissions from restaurants, subscription plans for customers, and fees from drivers. Here\u2019s how each model works:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Commission-Based Revenue Model<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Deliveroo makes money by taking a percentage of each order placed through its platform. This percentage usually ranges from 20% to 45%, depending on the restaurant and location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if a customer orders a meal worth \u00a320, and Deliveroo charges a 30% commission, the restaurant gets \u00a314, while Deliveroo keeps \u00a36 as its fee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, restaurants may need to pay a one-time onboarding fee of around $250-$300 to join the platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Subscription-Based Revenue Model (Premium Subscription Model)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Deliveroo offers a membership service called Deliveroo Plus, which allows customers to pay a fixed monthly fee for benefits like free delivery. There are two plans:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Gold (\u00a37.99\/month) \u2192 Free delivery on orders over \u00a310 at restaurants<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Silver (\u00a33.49\/month) \u2192 Free delivery on orders over \u00a315 at restaurants<br><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This model helps Deliveroo generate a steady monthly income while encouraging customers to order more frequently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if a customer orders food four times a month, instead of paying \u00a32.50 for delivery each time (\u00a310 total), they can subscribe to Gold for \u00a37.99 and save money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fee-Based Revenue Model<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This amount is refundable when the driver quits, but while it\u2019s held, Deliveroo can use it for business operations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if 1,000 new drivers join in a month, Deliveroo collects \u00a3150,000 in security deposits, which it can temporarily use to manage costs or invest in improvements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This model helps Deliveroo manage operational expenses while ensuring drivers take care of company-provided equipment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Deliveroo Edition<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Deliveroo has introduced an innovative concept called Deliveroo Editions. It is also known as dark kitchens. These are delivery-only kitchens with no dine-in space.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is designed to prepare food exclusively for online orders. Deliveroo either partners with existing kitchens or sets up its own, and profits are based on each setup.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"751\" src=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/how-does-deliveroo-make-money.webp\" alt=\"How Does Deliveroo Make Money?\" class=\"wp-image-23121\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/how-does-deliveroo-make-money.webp 900w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/how-does-deliveroo-make-money-300x250.webp 300w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/how-does-deliveroo-make-money-768x641.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Deliveroo Marketing Strategy &amp; Customer Acquisition<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Deliveroo uses various marketing strategies to attract and keep customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deliveroo uses various marketing strategies to attract and retain customers.

Deliveroo also has some competitors like-<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Uber Eats<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Just Eat<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>DoorDash<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Grubhub<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Postmates<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Swiggy<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delivery Hero<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>ChowNow<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Competitive Advantage: What Sets Deliveroo Apart?&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Deliveroo stands out in the competitive market through several key strategies. A major differentiator is its focus on offering a diverse selection of food from a wide range of restaurants.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By collaborating with both popular chains and local eateries, Deliveroo ensures there\u2019s something for everyone, catering to various tastes and preferences. This extensive menu variety enhances the customer experience, making the platform more attractive to a broad audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great thing about Deliveroo is how focused they are on fast delivery. They use smart technology and real-time tracking to make sure food gets to customers quickly and on time. This helps them give people a service that\u2019s both reliable and easy to trust.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, Deliveroo uses a smart system called \u2018Frank\u2019 to help make deliveries faster and smoother.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It looks at where the restaurant, rider, and customer are, then figures out the best route to get the food delivered as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Challenges in the Deliveroo Business Model<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Deliveroo is a major player in the food delivery industry, but sometimes, it faces numerous challenges and risks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a breakdown of the key challenges and risks that Deliveroo faces:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dependence on Third-Party Restaurants<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Deliveroo doesn\u2019t cook the food, it depends on a wide network of partner restaurants.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that if a restaurant serves poor food quality or shuts down unexpectedly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will directly impact Deliveroo\u2019s service.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers blame Deliveroo even if the issue started at the restaurant, which can hurt the platform&#8217;s reputation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Competition<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The food delivery market is crowded with strong players. Many other delivery apps compete with Deliveroo, which can lower profits and make it harder to get new customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Profitability<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Operating a food delivery service involves high costs, such as maintaining the app, customer service, logistics, and paying delivery riders.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even small inefficiencies can make a big difference at scale and pose a long-term challenge to financial sustainability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Labor Costs &amp; Worker Relations<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As governments and regulators rethink the gig economy. Deliveroo may be required to treat its riders as employees.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could mean higher wages, benefits, and protections for workers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is better for workers but these changes could significantly increase operational costs and complicate staffing flexibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Delivery Logistics<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Any disruption, like bad weather, road closures, or peak-hour traffic, can delay orders.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deliveroo has to juggle these real-world challenges constantly, and even a few slow deliveries can lead to poor reviews, refunds, or customers turning to competitors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rising Costs<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Prices for essentials like fuel, packaging, and wages are rising.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, customers expect competitive prices and free delivery deals.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This squeeze can reduce profit margins further. It forces Deliveroo to make tough choices between staying affordable and staying profitable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Want to build your own Deliveroo clone App?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a top-notch food delivery platform requires a strategic approach, robust technology, and a network of drivers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s where <a href=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/\">StackFood<\/a> comes in \u2013 the ultimate solution for building your own Deliveroo-style app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s why StackFood is your ideal partner in bringing your food delivery vision to life:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"907\" height=\"477\" src=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/stackfood-1.webp\" alt=\"StackFood\" class=\"wp-image-22305\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/stackfood-1.webp 907w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/stackfood-1-300x158.webp 300w, https:\/\/stackfood.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/stackfood-1-768x404.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n<style>.wp-block-kadence-advancedbtn.kb-btns23080_e12b40-44{gap:var(--global-kb-gap-xs, 0.5rem );justify-content:center;align-items:center;}.kt-btns23080_e12b40-44 .kt-button{font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;}.kt-btns23080_e12b40-44 .kt-btn-wrap-0{margin-right:5px;}.wp-block-kadence-advancedbtn.kt-btns23080_e12b40-44 .kt-btn-wrap-0 .kt-button{color:#555555;border-color:#555555;}.wp-block-kadence-advancedbtn.kt-btns23080_e12b40-44 .kt-btn-wrap-0 .kt-button:hover, .wp-block-kadence-advancedbtn.kt-btns23080_e12b40-44 .kt-btn-wrap-0 .kt-button:focus{color:#ffffff;border-color:#444444;}.wp-block-kadence-advancedbtn.kt-btns23080_e12b40-44 .kt-btn-wrap-0 .kt-button::before{display:none;}.wp-block-kadence-advancedbtn.kt-btns23080_e12b40-44 .kt-btn-wrap-0 .kt-button:hover, .wp-block-kadence-advancedbtn.kt-btns23080_e12b40-44 .kt-btn-wrap-0 .kt-button:focus{background:#444444;}<\/style>\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-advancedbtn kb-buttons-wrap kb-btns23080_e12b40-44\"><style>ul.menu .wp-block-kadence-advancedbtn .kb-btn23080_9f28b2-95.kb-button{width:initial;}<\/style><a class=\"kb-button kt-button button kb-btn23080_9f28b2-95 kt-btn-size-standard kt-btn-width-type-auto kb-btn-global-fill kt-btn-has-text-true kt-btn-has-svg-false  wp-block-kadence-singlebtn\" href=\"https:\/\/1.envato.market\/Y9Dmnm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"kt-btn-inner-text\"><strong>Get StackFood Now<\/strong><\/span><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">All-in-One Web Panels<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Admin Panel:<\/strong> Take control of your platform by managing users, orders, payments, and much more, all from one centralized dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Restaurant Panel:<\/strong> Give restaurants the power to handle their orders, update menus, and monitor performance seamlessly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Three Integrated Mobile Apps for Smooth Operations<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Customer App: <\/strong>Allow users to explore menus, place orders, and track their deliveries with ease.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Restaurant App: <\/strong>Let restaurants manage their incoming orders, update menu items, and coordinate with delivery drivers effortlessly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Driver App: <\/strong>Empower delivery personnel to receive orders, navigate to the destination, and complete deliveries with a user-friendly interface.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Additional Features You\u2019ll Love<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Flutter-based User Website:<\/strong> Get a beautifully designed website that\u2019s optimized for all devices, ensuring customers can access your service anytime, anywhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>React-Based User Website: <\/strong>Get a fast, responsive, and modern website using React that looks great on all devices.
